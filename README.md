Language Agents utilising Large Language Models to interact with the external world (e.g., through tools) to process collected observations towards solving a task have achieved great improvements in challenging reasoning tasks. A more effective design for language agents should have a better interplay between the implicit knowledge encoded in LLM's weight and the explicit knowledge of the external world. To this end, we present Uncertainty-Aware Language Agent that integrates uncertainty in language agent's cycle of Thought, Action, and Observation. The uncertainty moderates the interaction between the LLM and the external world, facilitating a more effective and efficient dynamic.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup
Configure Environment:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Configure OpenAI API (for GPT3.5):
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_KEY>
```
Configure Google Search API (for MMLU):
```
export SERPAPI_API_KEY=<YOUR_KEY>
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Free-from Question Answering (HotpotQA)

- GPT3.5: `python run_hotpotqa_gpt3.5.py`
- LLaMA2-70B: `python run_hotpotqa_llama2.py`

### Binary Question Answering (StrategyQA)

- GPT3.5: `python run_strategyqa_gpt3.5.py`
- LLaMA2-70B: `python run_strategyqa_llama2.py`

### Multiple Choice Question Answering (MMLU)

- GPT3.5: `python run_mmlu_gpt3.5.py`
- LLaMA2-70B: `python run_mmlu_llama2.py`

For different settings (standard, cot, react, uala), change the `mode` variable in script.
The uala setting here is UALA-S+Backoff, to use Oracle, set the `oracle` variable in script as `True`.

    abstract = "While Language Agents have achieved promising success by placing Large Language Models at the core of a more versatile design that dynamically interacts with the external world, the existing approaches neglect the notion of uncertainty during these interactions. We present the Uncertainty-Aware Language Agent (UALA), a framework that orchestrates the interaction between the agent and the external world using uncertainty quantification. Compared with other well-known counterparts like ReAct, our extensive experiments across 3 representative tasks (HotpotQA, StrategyQA, MMLU) and various LLM sizes demonstrate that UALA brings a significant improvement of performance, while having a substantially lower reliance on the external world (i.e., reduced number of tool calls and tokens). Our analyses provide various insights including the great potential of UALA compared with agent fine-tuning, and underscore the unreliability of verbalised confidence of LLMs as a proxy for uncertainty.",
