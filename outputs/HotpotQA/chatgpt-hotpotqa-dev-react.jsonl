As an epistemology (i.e., a study of knowledge, its nature, and verifiability), ethics (moral philosophy), and as a political science (i.e., in its concern with affairs of the citizenry), the field of postcolonialism addresses the matters that constitute the postcolonial identity of a decolonized people, which derives from:[1]. Postcolonialism is aimed at disempowering such theories (intellectual and linguistic, social and economic) by means of which colonialists \"perceive,\" \"understand,\" and \"know\" the world. Postcolonial theory thus establishes intellectual spaces for subaltern peoples to speak for themselves, in their own voices, and thus produce cultural discourses of philosophy, language, society, and economy, balancing the imbalanced us-and-them binary power-relationship between the colonist and the colonial subjects.[citation needed][2].\nThought 3: Hafiz Rashid Khan's academic discipline is postcolonialism.

His writings influenced the development of Western philosophy and Western Christianity, and he is viewed as one of the most important Church Fathers of the Latin Church in the Patristic Period. His many important works include The City of God, On Christian Doctrine, and Confessions.. According to his contemporary, Jerome, Augustine \"established anew the ancient Faith\".[a] In his youth he was drawn to the Manichaean faith, and later to the Hellenistic philosophy of Neoplatonism. After his conversion to Christianity and baptism in 386, Augustine developed his own approach to philosophy and theology, accommodating a variety of methods and perspectives.[24] Believing the grace of Christ was indispensable to human freedom, he helped formulate the doctrine of original sin and made significant contributions to the development of just war theory.\nThought 3: St. Augustine is a city in Florida and also the name of a theologian and philosopher.

The first European settler to explore the Flathead Valley was likely surveyor Peter Fidler of the Hudson’s Bay Company in the 18th century. From 1870, permanent settlement and the introduction of livestock brought permanent changes, as did the near-eradication of local bison populations.[7].

It is about 60 kilometers (37 mi) east of central Tokyo in Narita, Chiba.[2] The facility since July, 2019, covers 1,137 hectares (2,810 acres) of land and there are future plans to expand to nearly 1,200ha (3,000 acres)[3]. The conceptualization of Narita was highly controversial and remains so to the present day, especially among local residents in the area. This has led to the Sanrizuka Struggle, stemming from the government's decision to construct the airport without consulting most residents in the area, as well as expropriating their lands in the process. Even after the airport was eventually completed, air traffic movements have been controlled under various noise related operating restrictions due to its direct proximity with residential neighborhoods, including a house with a farm that is located right in between the runways.[4] As a result, the airport must be closed from 00:00 (12:00am) to 06:00 (6:00am) the next day to minimize the noise pollution impact around the airport.[5].\nThought 3: The head office of Narita International Airport is within Terminal 2.

While O'Hara's legacy as a writer is debated, his champions rank him highly among the under-appreciated and unjustly neglected major American writers of the 20th century.[2] Few college students educated after O'Hara's death in 1970 have discovered him, chiefly because he refused to allow his work to be reprinted in anthologies used to teach literature at the college level.. \"O’Hara may not have been the best story writer of the twentieth century, but he is the most addictive,\" wrote Lorin Stein, then editor-in-chief of the Paris Review, in a 2013 appreciation of O'Hara's work.

Author of the \"profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful\" poetry of Gitanjali,[7] he became in 1913 the first non-European and the first lyricist to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.[8] Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; where his elegant prose and magical poetry were widely popular in the Indian subcontinent.[9] He was a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society. Referred to as \"the Bard of Bengal\",[10][5][6] Tagore was known by sobriquets: Gurudeb, Kobiguru, and Biswokobi.[a]. A Bengali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Burdwan district[12] and Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old.[13] At the age of sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym Bhānusiṃha (\"Sun Lion\"), which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics.[14] By 1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas, published under his real name.

The dictator game is a derivative of the ultimatum game, in which one player (the proposer) provides a one-time offer to the other (the responder). The responder can choose to either accept or reject the proposer's bid, but rejecting the bid would result in both players receiving a payoff of 0.

The term \"gaming\"[2] in this context typically refers to instances in which the activity has been specifically permitted by law.

The character Carlo Gérard is partly based on Jean-Lambert Tallien, a leading figure in the Revolution. It remains popular with audiences, though less frequently performed than in the first half of the 20th century.

Based on a real-life story, the film centers on a taxi driver from Seoul who unintentionally becomes involved in the events of the Gwangju Uprising in 1980. It is based on German journalist Jürgen Hinzpeter's interactions with driver Kim Sa-bok; however, as very little information on Kim was  known at the time the film was made, most elements regarding his life and the events that happened to him outside of Gwangju are fictional.. The film was released on August 2, 2017, in South Korea.[6] It was very positively received by critics, who praised its unique approach to depicting the Gwangju Uprising events, emotional weight, as well as the main character and his relationship with Hinzpeter, and was selected as the South Korean entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 90th Academy Awards.[7][8] The film was a notable commercial success: it was the second highest grossing film of 2017 in South Korea, and currently stands as the twelfth highest-grossing South Korean film in history.[9][10].

The empire was founded on 18 January 1871, when the south German states, except for Austria, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, joined the North German Confederation and the new constitution came into force on 16 April, changing the name of the federal state to the German Empire and introducing the title of German Emperor for Wilhelm I, King of Prussia from the House of Hohenzollern.[25] Berlin remained its capital, and Otto von Bismarck, Minister President of Prussia, became Chancellor, the head of government. As these events occurred, the Prussian-led North German Confederation and its southern German allies, such as Baden, Bavaria, Württemberg, and Hesse, were still engaged in the Franco-Prussian War. The German Empire consisted of 25 states, each with its own nobility, four constituent kingdoms, six grand duchies, five duchies (six before 1876), seven principalities, three free Hanseatic cities, and one imperial territory. While Prussia was one of four kingdoms in the realm, it contained about two-thirds of the Empire's population and territory, and Prussian dominance was also constitutionally established, since the King of Prussia was also the German Emperor (Deutscher Kaiser)..\nThought 3: The German Empire used the 7.92×57mm Mauser cartridge in the 20th century.

Dieffenbachia is a perennial herbaceous plant with straight stem, simple and alternate leaves containing white spots and flecks, making it attractive as indoor foliage. Species in this genus are popular as houseplants because of their tolerance of shade. The English names, dumb cane and mother-in-law's tongue (also used for Sansevieria species) refer to the poisoning effect of raphides, which can cause temporary inability to speak.[6] Dieffenbachia was named by Heinrich Wilhelm Schott, director of the Botanical Gardens in Vienna, to honor his head gardener Joseph Dieffenbach (1796–1863)..\nThought 2: Dieffenbachia is a genus of tropical flowering plants in the family Araceae.

(Charpentier would later write a sequel, the opera Julien, describing the artist's aspirations.) Musically the work is verismo, it marks the beginning of naturalism in French opera..

Eric Blom wrote that the tragic fate of the opera was to be written a quarter of a century too soon.[2] However, the music has been greatly admired by composers including d'Indy, Ravel and Stravinsky.[3]. Around May 1883 Chabrier wrote to his publishers that for his next stage work he was hoping to create something like Offenbach's successful 'grand fantaisie' Le roi Carotte.[4] According to Victorin de Joncières, Chabrier had confided to him that he was looking for an amusing book to set. Joncières had been sent Le roi malgré lui, an old vaudeville of 1836[5] written by Marguerite-Louise Virginie Ancelot (1792–1875), by Ancelot's daughter Mme Lachaud.[6] However, Joncières passed the play to Chabrier, and also introduced Chabrier to Léon Carvalho, to whom Chabrier played some 'audition' pieces, which convinced the Opéra-Comique director to stage his work.[7].

In northern and midwestern areas of the United States, a barbecue restaurant may be referred to as a \"barbecue joint\".[4] In southern areas of the U.S., a barbecue restaurant may be referred to as a \"barbecue\" or \"barbecue place\", rather than as a barbecue restaurant.[4] Some barbecue restaurants may be referred to as \"shrines\" or as a \"barbecue shrine\",[5][6][7][8][9] which can refer to those that have earned a strong reputation for purveying high-quality food over the course of several years, and even over the course of generations.[10]. A churrascaria is a place where meat is cooked in churrasco style, which translates roughly from the Portuguese for 'barbecue'. A churrasqueiro is somebody who cooks churrasco style food in a churrascaria restaurant.[11] Some churrascarias offer all-you-can-eat dining in a style that is referred to as rodízio.[12][13] They may offer many types of barbecued meats.[12] In Brazil, a churrascart is a food cart that serves churrasco, and they are common in the country.[12].\nThought 5: BBQ restaurant is also known as a barbecue joint or barbecue place.

Born to a Jewish family,[2] Senreich graduated from Herricks High School in New Hyde Park, New York.[citation needed]. In 1996, Senreich was employed by Wizard Entertainment, gradually rising to become its editorial director.[3] In 1996 or 1997, Senreich met Green when the actor, a fan of Wizard magazine, responded enthusiastically to an interview request.[4] With Green, Senreich created in 2000 and 2001 Sweet J Presents, a web-based series of animated shorts presented on screenblast.com. Adult Swim contracted the Robot Chicken series on the basis of these shorts.[3]. Senreich and Green together run the production company Stoopid Monkey.[3] His Emmy nominations were shared with other key members of the  production staff of Robot Chicken, including partner Seth Green, for \"Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming Less Than One Hour)\" in 2007, 2008, and 2009.[5] Senreich received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Short-Format Animated Program (shared with key members of his production staff) at the 62nd annual Emmy Award ceremony held on August 29, 2010.[6].\nThought 2: The paragraph does not mention any comedy.

Their future existence is predicted based on theoretical models.[1]. Stars increase in luminosity as they age, and a more luminous star needs to radiate energy more quickly to maintain equilibrium. Stars larger than red dwarfs do this by increasing their size and becoming red giants with larger surface areas.\nThought 3: Blue dwarf (red-dwarf stage) is a type of star, not a game.

The book provides a look at the history and the Spanish traditions of bullfighting. It also contains a deeper contemplation on the nature of fear and courage. While essentially a guide book, there are three main sections: Hemingway's work, pictures, and a glossary of terms.. Hemingway became a bullfighting aficionado  after seeing the Pamplona fiesta in the 1920s, which he wrote about in The Sun Also Rises.[1] In Death in the Afternoon, Hemingway explores the metaphysics of bullfighting—the ritualized, almost religious practice—that he considered analogous to the writer's search for meaning and the essence of life.\nThought 2: Ernest Hemingway is the inventor of Death in the Afternoon.

He was the son of organist Cristoforo Benvenuti and studied at the Liceo Musicale (now the Conservatorio Giovanni Battista Martini) in Bologna under Luigi Torchi (musicology) and Marco Enrico Bossi (organ).[1] In 1919 his collection of songs for voice and piano accompaniment, Canti a una voce : con accompagnamento di pianoforte, was published in Bologna.[2] In 1922 he published a collection of 17th-century art songs entitled 35 Arie di vari autori del secolo XVII. Composer Samuel Barber studied the works of Giulio Caccini, Andrea Falconieri, and other early Italian composers under his tutelage in Milan in 1933–1934.[3] For the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma he adapted Claudio Monteverdi's L'Orfeo for a production which premiered on 27 December 1934.[4] The adaptation was later used for the first recording of L'Orfeo in 1939,[5] which included a performance by the orchestra of La Scala Milan under conductor Ferrucio Calusio.[6][7].

Born in Cremona, where he undertook his first musical studies and compositions, Monteverdi developed his career first at the court of Mantua (c. 1590–1613) and then until his death in the Republic of Venice where he was maestro di cappella at the basilica of San Marco.

Physical forms of homes can be static such as a house or an apartment, mobile such as a houseboat, trailer or yurt or digital such as virtual space.[1] The aspect of ‘home’ can be considered across scales; from the micro scale showcasing the most intimate spaces of the individual dwelling and direct surrounding area to the macro scale of the geographic area such as town, village, city, country or planet.. The concept of ‘home’ has been researched and theorized across disciplines – topics ranging from the idea of home, the interior, the psyche, liminal space, contested space to gender and politics.[2] The home as a concept expands beyond residence as contemporary lifestyles and technological advances redefine the way the global population lives and works.[citation needed] The concept and experience encompasses the likes of exile, yearning, belonging, homesickness and homelessness.[3].

Korine had devised the concept over several years prior to production, with fleeting ideas about the plot and what should transpire. His initial desire was to create a \"sensory film\" that was more about feeling than action and placed little importance on narrative or plot, the idea for which came later.[11] Once Korine developed the story's backbone, which takes place around the American spring break period, he traveled to Florida to write the screenplay.\nThought 3: Harmony Korine directed Spring Breakers in 2012.

The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball validly will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.[1][2].

These show the breadth of Hindu artwork traditions – Shiva, Vishnu, Devi and Vedic deities – fused into the same temple complex, depicted with a diversity of regional heritages, along with inscriptions in scripts from South and North India. The Hindu temples include Jaina reliefs in its panel.\nThought 2: The city was ransacked and looted twice by the forces of the Delhi Sultanate in the 14th century. I need to search Delhi Sultanate and find how long it existed.\nAction 2: Search[Delhi Sultanate]\nObservation 2: The Delhi Sultanate or the Sultanate of Delhi was a late medieval empire primarily based in Delhi that stretched over large parts of the Indian subcontinent, for 320 years (1206–1526).[11][12][13] Following the invasion of South Asia by the Ghurid dynasty, five largely unrelated dynasties ruled over the Delhi Sultanate sequentially: the Mamluk dynasty (1206–1290), the Khalji dynasty (1290–1320), the Tughlaq dynasty (1320–1414),[14] the Sayyid dynasty (1414–1451), and the Lodi dynasty (1451–1526). It covered large swaths of territory in modern-day India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh as well as some parts of southern Nepal.[15]. The foundation of the Sultanate was laid by the Ghurid conqueror Muhammad Ghori who routed the Rajput Confederacy led by Ajmer ruler Prithviraj Chauhan in 1192 near Tarain, after suffering a reverse against them earlier.[16] As a successor to the Ghurid dynasty, the Delhi Sultanate was originally one among a number of principalities ruled by the Turkic slave-generals of Muhammad Ghori, including Taj al-Din Yildiz, Qutb al-Din Aibak, Bahauddin Tughril and Nasir ad-Din Qabacha, that had inherited and divided the Ghurid territories amongst themselves.[17] Khalji and Tughlaq rule ushered a new wave of rapid and ceaseless Muslim conquests deep into South India.[18][19][20] The sultanate finally reached the peak of its geographical reach during the Tughlaq dynasty, occupying most of the Indian subcontinent under Muhammad bin Tughluq. A major political transformation occurred across Northern India, triggered by Central Asian conqueror Tamerlane's devastating raid on Delhi in 1398, followed soon afterwards by the reemergence of rival Hindu powers such as Vijayanagara and Mewar asserting independence, and new Muslim sultanates such as the Bengal and Bahmani Sultanates breaking off.[21][22] In 1526, Timurid ruler Babur invaded northern India and conquered the Sultanate, leading to its succession by the Mughal Empire.. The establishment of the Sultanate drew the Indian subcontinent more closely into international and multicultural Islamic social and economic networks,[23] as seen concretely in the development of the Hindustani language[24] and Indo-Islamic architecture.[25][26] It was also one of the few powers to repel attacks by the Mongols (from the Chagatai Khanate)[27] and saw the enthronment of one of the few female rulers in Islamic history, Razia Sultan, who reigned from 1236 to 1240.[28] Bakhtiyar Khalji's annexations involved a large-scale desecration of Hindu and Buddhist temples[29] (contributing to the decline of Buddhism in East India and Bengal),[30][31] and the destruction of universities and libraries.[32][33] Mongolian raids on West and Central Asia set the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, intelligentsia, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from those regions into the subcontinent, thereby establishing Islamic culture there.[34][35].\nThought 3: The Delhi Sultanate existed for 320 years (1206-1526). So the state that existed when Halebidu was ransacked and looted twice in the 14th century must have existed for less than 320 years.\nAction 3: Finish[less than 320 years]\nObservation 3: Episode finished, reward = 0"}

Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, halting Lee's invasion of the North and forcing his retreat. The battle involved the largest number of casualties of the entire war and is often described as the war's turning point, due to the Union's decisive victory and its almost simultaneous concurrence with the victorious conclusion of the Siege of Vicksburg.[fn 1][14].

The barrier on the Slovenian border is several kilometres long, located near the busiest border crossing, Spielfeld-Šentilj, and includes police facilities for screening and processing migrants.

The responses of national governments varied greatly.[8] Many European Union (EU) governments reacted by closing their borders, and most countries refused to take in the arriving refugees. Germany would ultimately accept most of the refugees after the government decided to temporarily suspend its enforcement of the Dublin Regulation.. Although the EU attempted to enact some reforms, these efforts largely fizzled out after refugee arrival numbers receded.[9] Attempted reforms included distributing refugees among member countries, tackling root causes of emigration in the home countries of migrants, and simplifying deportation processes.[8].\nThought 4: The barriers were designed to manage the increased movement of refugees and migrants into Europe during the European migrant crisis.

I can try searching for \"Westerners\" next.\nAction 3: Search[Westerners]\nObservation 3: The Western world, also known as the West, primarily refers to various nations and states in the regions of Australasia,[a] Europe,[b] and the Americas.[c][6] The Western world likewise is called the Occident (from Latin  occidēns 'setting down, sunset, west') in contrast to the Eastern world known as the Orient (from Latin  oriēns 'origin, sunrise, east'). The West is considered an evolving concept; made up of cultural, political, and economic synergy among diverse groups of people, and not a rigid region with fixed borders and members.[7] Definitions for \"Western world\" vary according to context and perspectives.[8]. Modern-day Western world essentially encompasses the nations and states where civilization or culture is considered Western[9][10][11]—the roots of which some historians have traced back to the Greco-Roman world and Christianity.[12][13] In the Global North–South schism, the West is often correlated with Global North.[14][15] A historic idea of Europe as the geographic West emerged in the fifth century BCE Greece.[16][17][18] A geographical concept of the West started to take shape in the 4th century CE when Constantine–the first Christian Roman emperor divided the Roman Empire between the Greek East and Latin West. The East Roman Empire, later called the Byzantine Empire, continued for a millennium, while the West Roman Empire lasted for only about a century and a half. This caused people in the Latin West to envy the Greek east and consider the Christians over there as heretics.[8] The politico-religious division between the Western church and Eastern Christian churches eventually culminated in the East–West Schism in 1054 CE.[19] Even though friendly relations continued between the two parts of the Christendom for some time, the crusades made the schism definitive with hostility.[20] The West during these crusades tried to capture trade routes to the East and failed, it instead discovered the Americas.[21] In the aftermath of European colonization of these newly discovered lands, an idea of the Western world, as an inheritor of Latin Christendom emerged.[22].\nThought 4: \"Westerners\" is not a Cantonese slang term either.

The grave had probably been looted by the time of Bateman's excavation, but still contained other high-status objects suggestive of a richly furnished burial, such as the fragmentary remains of a hanging bowl. The helmet is displayed at Sheffield's Weston Park Museum, which purchased it from Bateman's estate in 1893.. The helmet was constructed by covering the outside of an iron framework with plates of horn and the inside with cloth or leather; the organic material has since decayed.\nThought 3: The Pioneer Helmet and Benty Grange helmet are both Anglo-Saxon boar-crested helmets from the 7th century.

Although beer was a part of colonial life in the United States, the passing of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1919 resulted in the prohibition of alcoholic beverage sales, forcing nearly all American breweries to close or switch to producing non-alcoholic products. After the repeal of Prohibition, the industry consolidated into a small number of large-scale breweries. Many of the big breweries that returned to producing beer after Prohibition, today largely owned by international conglomerates like Anheuser-Busch InBev, still retain their dominance of the market in the 21st century.

The Nyāya Sūtras is a Hindu text,[note 1] notable for focusing on knowledge and logic, and making no mention of Vedic rituals.[9] The first book is structured as a general introduction and table of contents of sixteen categories of knowledge.[3] Book two is about pramana (epistemology), book three is about prameya or the objects of knowledge, and the text discusses the nature of knowledge in remaining books.[3] It set the foundation for Nyaya tradition of the empirical theory of validity and truth, opposing uncritical appeals to intuition or scriptural authority.[10]. The Nyaya sutras cover a wide range of topics, including Tarka-Vidyā, the science of debate or Vāda-Vidyā, the science of discussion.[11] The Nyāya Sutras are related to but extend the Vaiśeṣika epistemological and metaphysical system.[12] Later commentaries expanded, expounded and discussed Nyaya sutras, the earlier surviving commentaries being by Pakṣilasvāmin Vātsyāyana (5th–6th Century CE), followed by the Nyāyavārttika of Uddyotakāra (6th–7th Century CE), Vācaspati Miśra's Tātparyatīkā (9th Century CE), Udayana's Tātparyapariśuddhi (10th Century CE), and Jayanta's Nyāyamañjarī (10th Century CE).[13][14][15].

The name (Old English: Westmynstre)[2] originated from the informal description of the abbey church and royal peculiar of St Peter's (Westminster Abbey), west of the City of London (until the English Reformation there was also an Eastminster, near the Tower of London, in the East End of London). The abbey's origins date from between the 7th and 10th centuries, but it rose to national prominence when rebuilt by Edward the Confessor in the 11th century.

Although the origins of the church are obscure, there was certainly an abbey operating on the site by the mid-10th century housing Benedictine monks.[8] The church got its first grand building in the 1060s under the auspices of the English king Edward the Confessor, who is buried inside.[9] Construction of the present church began in 1245 on the orders of Henry III.[10] The monastery was dissolved in 1559 and the church was made a royal peculiar—a Church of England church responsible directly to the sovereign—by Elizabeth I.[11] In 1987, the abbey, together with the Palace of Westminster and St. Margaret's Church, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site because of its historic and symbolic significance.[12]. The Gothic architecture of the church is chiefly inspired by French and English styles from the 13th century,[13] although some sections of the church show earlier Romanesque styles,[14] or later Baroque,[15] and modern styles.[16] The Henry VII Chapel at the east end of the church is a typical example of Perpendicular Gothic architecture; the antiquarian John Leland said of it that it was orbis miraculum (\"the wonder of the world\").[17].\nThought 4: Westminster Abbey is an Anglican church in the City of Westminster, London, England.

A double A-side single from the album, \"Something\" / \"Come Together\", was released in October, which also topped the charts in the US.. Abbey Road incorporates styles such as rock, pop, blues, singer-songwriter, and progressive rock,[4] and makes prominent use of the Moog synthesizer and guitar played through a Leslie speaker unit.

The Scandinavian countries dominated the Olympics in the Nordic events shooting 6.5 mm center fire cartridges like the 6.5×55mm until 1972 when the centerfire shooting events were dropped.[6] However, in North America the .264 caliber did not make much of a head way in terms of popularity. Beginning in the 1950s several ex-service Norwegian Krag–Jørgensen and Swedish Mauser began trickling into the United States.[6] Winchester had designed the .264 Winchester Magnum but it did not gain much of a following and the rifles were plagued by short barrel lives..\nThought 4: The 6.5mm Remington Magnum was popular in Europe and especially in Scandinavian countries.

(a film directed by his uncle Carol Reed), Women in Love (1969), Hannibal Brooks (1969), The Devils (1971), Athos in The Three Musketeers (1973) and The Four Musketeers (1974), the stepfather in Tommy (1975), Funny Bones (1995) and Gladiator (2000).. For playing Antonius Proximo, the old, gruff gladiator trainer in Ridley Scott's Gladiator, in what was his final film, Reed was posthumously nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role in 2000. At the peak of his career, in 1971, British exhibitors voted Reed fifth-most-popular star at the box office.[1] The British Film Institute (BFI) stated that \"partnerships with Michael Winner and Ken Russell in the mid-[19]60s saw Reed become an emblematic Brit-flick icon\", but from the mid-1970s his alcoholism began affecting his career, with the BFI adding: \"Reed had assumed Robert Newton's mantle as Britain's thirstiest thespian\".[2]. Robert Oliver Reed was born on 13 February 1938 at 9 Durrington Park Road,[3] Wimbledon, southwest London, to Peter Reed, a sports journalist, and Marcia (née Napier-Andrews).[4] He was the nephew of film director Sir Carol Reed, and grandson of the actor-manager Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree and his mistress, Beatrice May Pinney (who later assumed the name 'Reed'),[5] she being \"the only person who understood, listened to, encouraged and kissed Oliver\".[6] Reed claimed to have been a descendant (through an illegitimate step) of Peter the Great, Tsar of Russia.[7] Reed attended 14 schools,[8] including Ewell Castle School in Surrey.\nThought 2: Oliver Reed was an English actor.

The mosque was commissioned by Sultan Mustafa III to serve as his imperial or sultanic mosque.[2][3] Although it was tradition among earlier sultans to build their imperial mosque in commemoration of a major military success, Mustafa III ignored this tradition by ordering the construction before any such victories.[3] Construction began on 5 April 1760 and was completed on 9 March 1764.[4][3] According to a contemporary writer, the mosque was officially named Nur Mustafa ('Light of Mustafa'), but it became popularly known as the Laleli Mosque ('Mosque of the Tulips') after the name of the neighbourhood where it was built.[3]. The architect of the mosque is not confirmed by historical documentation, but art historians have attributed the mosque to Mehmed Tahir Agha, the chief imperial architect at the time of the mosque's completion.[a][2][4][5] On average, about 770 workers were employed in the project and about two thirds of them were non-Muslims, the rest being Muslim.[5]. The mosque was the centerpiece of a larger complex (külliye) that included the Mustafa III's tomb, a nearby caravanserai which provided some revenues to the complex, a sebil, and a madrasa.[6] Mustafa III was buried in the mausoleum attached to the complex after his death in 1774.[7] The mosque and its complex were damaged by the 1766 earthquake[4] and, according to Ünver Rüstem, by a fire in 1783.[7] In 1783 it was fully restored.[7][2] The restoration, which Doğan Kuban attributes to the architect Seyit Mustafa Agha,[4][2] preserved the original mosque's appearance.[7] The mausoleum's façade was updated with new marble window frames in the early 19th century.[6] The madrasa of the complex was destroyed by fire in 1911.[6]. The mosque was built in the Ottoman Baroque style of its time.[8][9][10] The layout is based on that of the earlier Selimiye Mosque of Edirne from the classical period, in accordance with Mustafa III's wishes.[11][5] The decoration of the mosque and its complex is firmly baroque.[12][2] The mosque incorporates thus the visual style of the earlier Nuruosmaniye Mosque – the first imperial mosque in the Ottoman Baroque style, completed by Mustafa III's predecessor – but in a more restrained way that integrates it with more traditional Ottoman architecture.[13].\nThought 2: I need to find the location of Laleli Mosque. \nAction 2: Lookup[location]\nObservation 2: No more results.\n\nThought 3: I need to search Esma Sultan Mansion and find its location.\nAction 3: Search[Esma Sultan Mansion]\nObservation 3: The Esma Sultan Mansion (Turkish: Esma Sultan Yalısı), a historical yalı located on the Bosphorus in the Ortaköy neighborhood of Istanbul, Turkey and named after its original owner Princess Esma Sultan, is used today as a cultural center after being redeveloped..

It was presented to the Princess Esma Sultan, the daughter of Ottoman Sultan Abdulaziz, as a wedding gift in 1889.. The mansion remained in the possession of the Ottoman dynasty until 1915.
