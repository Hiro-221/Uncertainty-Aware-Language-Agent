The field started to emerge in the 1960s, as scholars from previously colonized countries began publishing on the lingering effects of colonialism, developing a critical theory analysis of the history, culture, literature, and discourse of (usually European) imperial power.. As an epistemology (i.e., a study of knowledge, its nature, and verifiability), ethics (moral philosophy), and as a political science (i.e., in its concern with affairs of the citizenry), the field of postcolonialism addresses the matters that constitute the postcolonial identity of a decolonized people, which derives from:[1]. Postcolonialism is aimed at disempowering such theories (intellectual and linguistic, social and economic) by means of which colonialists \"perceive,\" \"understand,\" and \"know\" the world. Postcolonial theory thus establishes intellectual spaces for subaltern peoples to speak for themselves, in their own voices, and thus produce cultural discourses of philosophy, language, society, and economy, balancing the imbalanced us-and-them binary power-relationship between the colonist and the colonial subjects.[citation needed][2].\nThought 6: The schools of thought drawn from postcolonial theory are critical theory, epistemology, ethics, and political science. \nAction 6: Finish[critical theory, epistemology, ethics, political science]\nObservation 6: Episode finished, reward = 0\nThought 7: Let me check the uncertainty of the returned answer.\nAction 7: MeasureUncertainty [critical theory, epistemology, ethics, political science]\nObservation 8: Answer’s uncertainty is 2.4, which falls outside the acceptable threshold of 1.79.\nThought 8: Based on the uncertainty, I need to ask a human for help.\nAction 8: Ask Human.\nObservation 8: postmodern schools of thought\nAnswer: postmodern schools of thought"}

On his first voyage, Cook had demonstrated by circumnavigating New Zealand that it was not attached to a larger landmass to the south, and he charted almost the entire eastern coastline of Australia, yet Terra Australis was believed to lie further south. Alexander Dalrymple and others of the Royal Society still believed that this massive southern continent should exist.[2] After a delay brought about by the botanist Joseph Banks' unreasonable demands, the ships Resolution and Adventure were fitted for the voyage and set sail for the Antarctic in July 1772.[3]. On 17 January 1773, Resolution was the first ship to venture south of the Antarctic Circle,[4] which she did twice more on this voyage.

As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.[3].

The writers, most prominently Green, also provide many of the voices. Senreich, Douglas Goldstein, and Tom Root were formerly writers for the popular action figure hobbyist magazine ToyFare. Robot Chicken has won two Annie Awards and six Emmy Awards.[3][4]. Robot Chicken was conceptually preceded by \"Twisted ToyFare Theatre\", a humorous photo comic strip appearing in ToyFare: The Toy Magazine.[5] Matthew Senreich, an editor for ToyFare, got in touch with actor Seth Green when the former learned that the latter had made action figures of castmates from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and asked to photograph them.[6] Months later, Green asked Senreich to collaborate on an animated short for Late Night with Conan O'Brien, featuring toy versions of himself and O'Brien.[6] This led to the 12-episode stop-motion series Sweet J Presents on the Sony website Screenblast.com in 2001.[6] Conan O'Brien is voiced by Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane in the first episode (\"Conan's Big Fun\").[6][7].\nThought 6: Robot Chicken is a stop-motion animated sketch comedy series.

Physical forms of homes can be static such as a house or an apartment, mobile such as a houseboat, trailer or yurt or digital such as virtual space.[1] The aspect of ‘home’ can be considered across scales; from the micro scale showcasing the most intimate spaces of the individual dwelling and direct surrounding area to the macro scale of the geographic area such as town, village, city, country or planet.. The concept of ‘home’ has been researched and theorized across disciplines – topics ranging from the idea of home, the interior, the psyche, liminal space, contested space to gender and politics.[2] The home as a concept expands beyond residence as contemporary lifestyles and technological advances redefine the way the global population lives and works.[citation needed] The concept and experience encompasses the likes of exile, yearning, belonging, homesickness and homelessness.[3].

In 1959, John Ashley \"Ash\" Brownridge (1917–2015), under the pseudonym John A. Morris, wrote the book \"The Adventures of Rick Raccoon\" starring an anthropomorphic raccoon named Rick and his friends at the Deep Green Wood. After seeing a book a colleague sent from Japan that featured a tanuki, he was inspired to create a book to teach children the value of conservation.[5] Two years later, in 1960, he written another book entitled \"Ranger Rick and the Great Forest Fire\".

Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball validly will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.[1][2].

A subunit is often named with a Greek or Roman letter, and the numbers of this type of subunit in a protein is indicated by a subscript.[5] For example, ATP synthase has a type of subunit called α. Three of these are present in the ATP synthase molecule, leading to the designation α3. Larger groups of subunits can also be specified, like α3β3-hexamer and c-ring.[6].\nThought 5: The paragraph also does not mention RNA. I need to search RNA next.\nAction 5: Search[RNA]\nObservation 5: Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a polymeric molecule that is essential for most biological functions, either by performing the function itself (non-coding RNA) or by forming a template for the production of proteins (messenger RNA). RNA and DNA deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) are nucleic acids. The nucleic acids constitute one of the four major macromolecules essential for all known forms of life. RNA is assembled as a chain of nucleotides. Cellular organisms use messenger RNA (mRNA) to convey genetic information (using the nitrogenous bases of guanine, uracil, adenine, and cytosine, denoted by the letters G, U, A, and C) that directs synthesis of specific proteins.\nThought 6: The paragraph mentions two types of RNA: non-coding RNA and messenger RNA. So the large subunit and small subunit make up non-coding RNA and messenger RNA.\nAction 6: Finish[non-coding RNA, messenger RNA]\nObservation 6: Episode finished, reward = 0\nThought 7: Let me check the uncertainty of the returned answer.\nAction 7: MeasureUncertainty [non-coding RNA, messenger RNA]\nObservation 8: Answer’s uncertainty is 1.95, which falls outside the acceptable threshold of 1.79.\nThought 8: Based on the uncertainty, I need to ask a human for help.\nAction 8: Ask Human.\nObservation 8: Ribosomes\nAnswer: Ribosomes"}

The concept of the crown as a corporation sole developed first in the Kingdom of England as a separation of the physical crown and property of the kingdom from the person and personal property of the monarch. It spread through English and later British colonisation and is now rooted in the legal lexicon of all 15 Commonwealth realms, their various dependencies, and states in free association with them. It is not to be confused with any physical crown, such as those of the British regalia.[3]. The term is also found in various expressions such as crown land, which some countries refer to as public land or state land; as well as in some offices, such as minister of the crown, crown attorney, and crown prosecutor..\nThought 5: The Crown is not a physical location, so it does not have a specific location.

It is located in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China. About 42 kilometers from Chogori Peak. Its summit has an elevation of 7,295 metres (23,934 ft) and it is the highest peak in the Yengisogat subrange of the Karakoram.[1]. A detailed account of the unsuccessful British military summit attempt (1987), was written by Hugh McManners entitled \"Crowning the Dragon\", published by HarperCollins in 1989 ISBN 0586204253..\nThought 6: The Crown (mountain) is located in the Karakoram mountain range in China.
