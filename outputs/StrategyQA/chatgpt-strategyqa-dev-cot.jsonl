This means that a rock would sink in the atmosphere and not float. However, if the rock is light enough, it may be able to float in the upper layers of the atmosphere, where the air is less dense.

However, rhino horns have been used in traditional medicine and are believed to have aphrodisiac properties in some cultures. This has led to a high demand for rhino horns, resulting in poaching and illegal trade, which has greatly contributed to the decline of rhino populations.
