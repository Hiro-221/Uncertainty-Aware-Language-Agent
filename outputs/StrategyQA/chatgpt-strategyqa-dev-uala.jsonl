The representation of Jesus himself on the cross is referred to in English as the corpus (Latin for 'body').[1][2]. The crucifix is a principal symbol for many groups of Christians, and one of the most common forms of the Crucifixion in the arts. It is especially important in the Catholic Church, but is also used in the Eastern Orthodox Church, most Oriental Orthodox Churches (except the Armenian & Syriac Church), Lutheranism, Anglicanism.[3][4][5] The symbol is less common in churches of other Protestant denominations, and in the Assyrian Church of the East and Armenian Apostolic Church, which prefer to use a cross without the figure of Jesus (the corpus).[6][7] The crucifix emphasizes Jesus' sacrifice—his death by crucifixion, which Christians believe brought about the redemption of mankind. Most crucifixes portray Jesus on a Latin cross, rather than any other shape, such as a Tau cross or a Coptic cross..\nThought 4: A crucifix is a symbol commonly used in the Catholic Church, but also used in other Christian denominations.

It depicts the goddess Venus arriving at the shore after her birth, when she had emerged from the sea fully-grown (called Venus Anadyomene and often depicted in art). The painting is in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy.. Although the two are not a pair, the painting is inevitably discussed with Botticelli's other very large mythological painting, the Primavera, also in the Uffizi. They are among the most famous paintings in the world, and icons of Italian Renaissance painting; of the two, the Birth is better known than the Primavera.[1]  As depictions of subjects from classical mythology on a very large scale they were virtually unprecedented in Western art since classical antiquity, as was the size and prominence of a nude female figure in the Birth.\nThought 6: The Birth of Venus is a famous painting by Sandro Botticelli, depicting the goddess Venus arriving at the shore after her birth.

A cause of death is determined by a medical examiner. In rare cases, an autopsy needs to be performed by a pathologist. The cause of death is a specific disease or injury, in contrast to the manner of death, which is a small number of categories like \"natural\", \"accident\", \"suicide\", and \"homicide\", each with different legal implications.[1]. International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes can be used to record manner and cause of death in a systematic way that makes it easy to compile statistics and more feasible to compare events across jurisdictions.[2].\nThought 5: Amy Winehouse's cause of death was drug overdose, so I need to search for Narcan and its use in drug overdose cases.\nAction 5: Search[Narcan]\nObservation 5: Naloxone is an opioid antagonist: a medication used to reverse or reduce the effects of opioids.[13] For example, it is used to restore  breathing after an opioid overdose.[13] Effects begin within two minutes when given intravenously, five minutes when injected into a muscle,[13] and ten minutes as a nasal spray.[14] Naloxone blocks the effects of opioids for 30 to 90 minutes.[15]. Administration to opioid-dependent individuals may cause symptoms of opioid withdrawal, including restlessness, agitation, nausea, vomiting, a fast heart rate, and sweating.[13] To prevent this, small doses every few minutes can be given until the desired effect is reached.[13] In those with previous heart disease or taking medications that negatively affect the heart, further heart problems have occurred.[13] It appears to be safe in pregnancy, after having been given to a limited number of women.[16] Naloxone is a non-selective and competitive opioid receptor antagonist.[6][17] It works by reversing the depression of the central nervous system and respiratory system caused by opioids.[13]. Naloxone was patented in 1961 and approved for opioid overdose in the United States in 1971.[18][19] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.[20] Naloxone is available as a generic medication.[13][21]. Naloxone is useful in treating both acute opioid overdose and respiratory or mental depression due to opioids.[13] Whether it is useful in those in cardiac arrest due to an opioid overdose is unclear.[22]. It is included as a part of emergency overdose response kits distributed to heroin and other opioid drug users, and to emergency responders.\nThought 6: Narcan is a medication used to reverse the effects of opioids, including drug overdose.

Patients often choose voluntary commitment, but those who psychiatrists believe pose significant danger to themselves or others may be subject to involuntary commitment and involuntary treatment.[1][2] Psychiatric hospitals are sometimes referred to as psychiatric wards/units, psych, wards, or units when they are located in a hospital..\nThought 5: There is no mention of the Air Force in the description of psychiatric hospitals.

It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as jam, juice, pies, ice cream, milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in products such as candy, soap, lip gloss, perfume, and many others.. The garden strawberry was first bred in Brittany, France, in the 1750s via a cross of Fragaria virginiana from eastern North America and Fragaria chiloensis, which was brought from Chile by Amédée-François Frézier in 1714.[2] Cultivars of Fragaria × ananassa have replaced, in commercial production, the woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca), which was the first strawberry species cultivated in the early 17th century.[3].\nThought 5: Strawberries are widely appreciated for their aroma, color, and sweetness.

I need to search fear of needles.\nAction 4: Search[fear of needles]\nObservation 4: Fear of needles, known in medical literature as needle phobia, is the extreme fear of medical procedures involving injections or hypodermic needles. This can lead to avoidance of medical care and vaccine hesitancy.. It is occasionally referred to as aichmophobia, although this term may also refer to a more general fear of sharply pointed objects.. The condition was officially recognized in 1994 in the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition) as a specific phobia of blood-injection-injury type phobia (BII phobia). Phobic level responses to injections cause sufferers to avoid inoculations, blood tests, and in the more severe cases, all medical care..\nThought 5: Fear of needles is a specific phobia, and it is not mentioned in Post Malone's biography.

The OPC is considered to have had an influence on evangelicalism far beyond its size.[2]. The Orthodox Presbyterian Church was founded in 1936, through the efforts of John Gresham Machen.

Brands, Inc. The restaurants serve a variety of Mexican-inspired foods, including tacos, burritos, quesadillas, nachos, novelty and speciality items, and a variety of \"value menu\" items. As of 2018[update], Taco Bell serves over two billion customers each year, at 7,072 restaurants, more than 93 percent of which are owned and operated by independent franchisees and licensees.[6]. PepsiCo purchased Taco Bell in 1978,[7] and later spun off its restaurants division as Tricon Global Restaurants, which later changed its name to Yum! Brands.. Taco Bell was founded by Glen Bell, an entrepreneur who first opened a hot dog stand called Bell's Drive-In in San Bernardino, California, in 1948.\nThought 4: Taco Bell serves over two billion customers each year.\nAction 4: Search[Roy Rogers]\nObservation 4: Roy Rogers (born Leonard Franklin Slye; November 5, 1911 – July 6, 1998), nicknamed the King of the Cowboys,[1] was an American singer, actor, television host, and rodeo performer.. Following early work under his given name, first as co-founder of the Sons of the Pioneers and then as an actor, the rebranded Rogers then became one of the most famous and popular Western stars of his era.. He appeared in almost 90 films, as well as numerous episodes of his self-titled radio program for nine years. Between 1951 and 1957, he was the host of The Roy Rogers Show television series. In many of them, he appeared with his wife, Dale Evans; his Golden Palomino, Trigger; and his German Shepherd, Bullet.\nThought 5: Roy Rogers was a popular Western star and appeared in almost 90 films, but it does not mention the number of customers they serve each year. I need to search for more information.\nAction 5: Search[customers]\nObservation 5: In sales, commerce and economics, a customer (sometimes known as a client, buyer or purchaser) is the recipient of a good, service, product or an idea, obtained from a seller, vendor or supplier via a financial transaction or an exchange for money or some  other valuable consideration.[1][2]. Early societies relied on a gift economy based on favours. Later, as commerce developed, less permanent human relations were formed, depending more on transitory needs rather than enduring social desires. Customers are generally said to be the purchasers of goods and services, while clients are those who receive personalized advice and solutions.[3] Although such distinctions have no contemporary semantic weight, agencies such as law firms, film studios, and health care providers tend to prefer client, while grocery stores, banks, and restaurants tend to prefer customer instead.. The term client is derived from Latin clients or care meaning \"to incline\" or \"to bend\", and is related to the emotive idea of closure.\nThought 6: It does not mention the number of customers for Roy Rogers either. I need to search for more information.\nAction 6: Search[traffic]\nObservation 6: Traffic comprises pedestrians, vehicles, ridden or herded animals, trains, and other conveyances that use public ways (roads) for travel and transportation.. Traffic laws govern and regulate traffic, while rules of the road include traffic laws and informal rules that may have developed over time to facilitate the orderly and timely flow of traffic.[1] Organized traffic generally has well-established priorities, lanes, right-of-way, and traffic control at intersections.. Traffic is formally organized in many jurisdictions, with marked lanes, junctions, intersections, interchanges, traffic signals, or signs. Traffic is often classified by type: heavy motor vehicle (e.g., car, truck), other vehicle (e.g., moped, bicycle), and pedestrian. Different classes may share speed limits and easement, or may be segregated.\nThought 7: Traffic laws and regulations govern the flow of traffic, but it does not mention the specific number of people who go in and out of Taco Bell and Roy Rogers each year. I need to search for more information.\nAction 7: Search[annual traffic]\nObservation 7: Could not find annual traffic.

I need to compare the number of locations for each restaurant.\nAction 8: Search[locations]\nObservation 8: In geography, location or place are used to denote a region (point, line, or area) on Earth's surface. The term location generally implies a higher degree of certainty than place, the latter often indicating an entity with an ambiguous boundary, relying more on human or social attributes of place identity and sense of place than on geometry. A populated place is called a settlement.. A locality, settlement, or populated place is likely to have a well-defined name but a boundary that is not well defined varies by context. London, for instance, has a legal boundary, but this is unlikely to completely match with general usage.\nThought 9: It does not mention the number of locations for Taco Bell and Roy Rogers. I need to search for more information.\nAction 9: Search[number of locations]\nObservation 9: Could not find number of locations.

The character, who first appeared in Adventure Comics #283 (April 1961), was created by Robert Bernstein and initially designed by George Papp.[1] As a Kryptonian, he exhibits the same powers and abilities as Superman and is consequently viewed as one of his greatest enemies alongside Lex Luthor, Darkseid and Brainiac. He is also well known for his famous catchphrase, \"Kneel before Zod!\".. Originally bald and clean-shaven, Zod's look in popular culture was defined by the character's depiction by Terence Stamp in the films Superman (1978) and Superman II (1981). Eventually, the character was reintroduced to the DC Multiverse with black hair and a goatee beard similar to Stamp's portrayal.\nThought 4: General Zod is a supervillain and an adversary of Superman.

The Samsung Galaxy S4 is an Android smartphone produced by Samsung Electronics as the fourth smartphone of the Samsung Galaxy S series and was first shown publicly on March 14, 2013, at Samsung Mobile Unpacked in New York City. It is the successor to the Galaxy S III, which maintains a similar design, but with upgraded hardware, more sensors, and an increased focus on software features that take advantage of its hardware capabilities—such as the ability to detect when a finger is hovered over the screen, and expanded eye tracking functionality, it was released the previous year.[9][10] A hardware variant of the S4 became the first smartphone to support the emerging LTE Advanced mobile network standard (model number GT-i9506). The T-Mobile version of the Galaxy S4, named the model (SGH-M919), was released the same month.\nThought 6: The Samsung Galaxy S4 is an Android smartphone with various hardware variants.

She became the queen of the underworld after her abduction by and marriage to her uncle Hades, the king of the underworld.[6]. The myth of her abduction, her sojourn in the underworld, and her temporary return to the surface represents her functions as the embodiment of spring and the personification of vegetation, especially grain crops, which disappear into the earth when sown, sprout from the earth in spring, and are harvested when fully grown. In Classical Greek art, Persephone is invariably portrayed robed, often carrying a sheaf of grain. She may appear as a mystical divinity with a sceptre and a little box, but she was mostly represented in the process of being carried off by Hades..\nThought 4: Persephone is the queen of the underworld and the personification of vegetation.

It is primarily undertaken for aesthetic purposes over functional ones, distinguishing it from similar activities such as powerlifting, which focuses solely on increasing the physical load one can exert.. In competitive bodybuilding, competitors appear onstage in line-ups and perform specified poses (and later individual posing routines) for a panel of judges who rank them based on conditioning, muscularity, posing, size, stage presentation, and symmetry.[2] Bodybuilders prepare for competitions by exercising and eliminating non-essential body fat. This is enhanced at the final stage by a combination of carbohydrate loading and dehydration to achieve maximum muscle definition and vascularity. Most bodybuilders also tan and shave their bodies prior to competition.[3].\nThought 4: Bodybuilders focus on building and controlling their muscles for aesthetic purposes. They also prepare for competitions by eliminating non-essential body fat and enhancing muscle definition. \nAction 4: Search[elk burger]\nObservation 4: Could not find elk burger.

Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a \"special sauce\", often a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger patty topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.[1]. Hamburgers are often sold at fast-food restaurants and diners, but are also sold at various other restaurants. There are many international and regional variations of hamburger.\nThought 6: Beef burgers are commonly served with cheese, which is a good source of protein for bodybuilders.

A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as a representative and senator from California and as the 36th vice president from 1953 to 1961 under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. His presidency saw the reduction of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, détente with the Soviet Union and China, the Apollo 11 Moon landing, and the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency and Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\nThought 5: Richard Nixon was involved in the Watergate scandal, which led to his resignation. This may have caused disappointment in his mother, but it is not clear if she would still be proud of him.\nAction 5: Search[Watergate scandal]\nObservation 5: The Watergate scandal was a major political scandal in the United States involving the administration of President Richard Nixon from 1972 to 1974 that led to Nixon's resignation. The scandal stemmed from the Nixon administration's attempts to cover up its involvement in the June 17, 1972, break-in of the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, D.C., at the Watergate Office Building.. After the five perpetrators were arrested, the press and the Department of Justice connected the cash found on them at the time to the Committee for the Re-Election of the President.[1][2] Further investigations, along with revelations during subsequent trials of the burglars, led the House of Representatives to grant the U.S. House Judiciary Committee additional investigative authority—to probe into \"certain matters within its jurisdiction\",[3][4] and led the Senate to create the U.S. Senate Watergate Committee, which held hearings.\nThought 6: The Watergate scandal was a major scandal that led to Richard Nixon's resignation.

Founded in an era when there was much public interest in the occult, witchcraft and Satanism,  the  church enjoyed a heyday for  several years after its founding.

Black-tailed jackrabbits occupy mixed shrub-grassland terrains. Their breeding depends on the location; it typically peaks in spring, but may continue all year round in warm climates. Young are born fully furred with eyes open; they are well camouflaged and are mobile within minutes of birth, thus females do not protect or even stay with the young except during nursing.\nThought 4: Black-tailed jackrabbits are found in the western United States and Mexico, and European wildcats are found in Europe.

Chromophobia may also refer to an aversion of use of color in products or design.[4] Within cellular biology, \"chromophobic\" cells are a classification of cells that do not attract hematoxylin,[5] and is related to chromatolysis.[6]. Names exist that mean fear of specific colors such as erythrophobia for the fear of red, xanthophobia for the fear of yellow and leukophobia for the fear of white.[2] A fear of the color red may be associated with a fear of blood.[2]. In his book Chromophobia  published in 2000, David Batchelor says that in Western culture, color has often been treated as corrupting, foreign or superficial.[7] Michael  Taussig states that the cultural aversion to color can be traced back a thousand years,[8] with Batchelor stating that it can be traced back to Aristotle's privileging of line over color.[9]. In a study, hatchling Loggerhead sea turtles were found to have an aversion to lights in the yellow wave spectrum which is thought to be a characteristic that helps orient themselves toward the ocean.[10][11] The Mediterranean sand smelt, Atherina hepsetus, has shown an aversion to red objects placed next to a tank while it will investigate objects of other colors.[12] In other experiments, geese have been conditioned to have adverse reactions to foods of a particular color, although the reaction was not observed in reaction to colored water.[13].\nThought 5: Chromophobia is a fear of colors, and the Flag of the United States has multiple colors.

It can be made with varying recipes according to personal preference. Simple variants include using different types of lettuce or tomatoes, toasting or not, or adding mayonnaise. More pronounced variants can include using turkey bacon or tofu in place of bacon, or removing the lettuce entirely..

A major figure in the abstract expressionist movement, Pollock was widely noticed for his \"drip technique\" of pouring or splashing liquid household paint onto a horizontal surface, enabling him to view and paint his canvases from all angles. It was called all-over painting and action painting, since he covered the entire canvas and used the force of his whole body to paint, often in a frenetic dancing style. This extreme form of abstraction divided the critics: some praised the immediacy of the creation, while others derided the random effects. In 2016, Pollock's painting titled Number 17A was reported to have fetched US$200 million in a private purchase..\nThought 4: Jackson Pollock was an American painter known for his \"drip technique\". I need to search his parents and The Pledge of Allegiance.\nAction 4: Search[parents]\nObservation 4: A parent is either the progenitor of a child or, in humans, it can refer to a caregiver or legal guardian. The gametes of a parent result in a child, a male through the sperm, and a female through the ovum. Parents are first-degree relatives and have 50% genetic meet. A female can also become a parent through surrogacy. Some parents may be adoptive parents, who nurture and raise an offspring, but are not biologically related to the child.\nThought 5: Jackson Pollock's parents are not mentioned in this passage. I need to search The Pledge of Allegiance.\nAction 5: Search[The Pledge of Allegiance]\nObservation 5: The Pledge of Allegiance is a patriotic recited verse that promises allegiance to the flag of the United States and the republic of the United States of America. The first version, with a text different from the one used at present, was written in 1885 by Captain George Thatcher Balch, a Union Army officer in the Civil War who later authored a book on how to teach patriotism to children in public schools.[5][6][7]  In 1892, Francis Bellamy revised Balch's verse as part of a magazine promotion surrounding the World's Columbian Exposition, which celebrated the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' arrival in the Americas. Bellamy, the circulation manager for The Youth's Companion magazine, helped persuade then-president Benjamin Harrison to institute Columbus Day as a national holiday and lobbied Congress for a national school celebration of the day.[8] The magazine sent leaflets containing part of Bellamy's Pledge of Allegiance to schools across the country and on October 21, 1892, over 10,000 children recited the verse together.[9]. Bellamy's version of the pledge is largely the same as the one formally adopted by Congress 50 years later, in 1942.[10] The official name of The Pledge of Allegiance was adopted in 1945. The most recent alteration of its wording came on Flag Day (June 14) in 1954, when the words \"under God\" were added.[11].\nThought 6: The Pledge of Allegiance was written in 1885 and revised in 1892.

Variants of the tale are known across Europe.[7] In France, for example, Zémire and Azor is an operatic version of the story, written by Jean-François Marmontel and composed by André Grétry in 1771, which had enormous success into the 19th century.[8] Zémire and Azor is based on the second version of the tale. Amour pour amour (Love for Love) by Pierre-Claude Nivelle de La Chaussée is a 1742 play based on de Villeneuve's version.

In fracture healing, endochondral osteogenesis is the most commonly occurring process, for example in fractures of long bones treated by plaster of Paris, whereas fractures treated by open reduction and internal fixation with metal plates, screws, pins, rods and nails may heal by intramembranous osteogenesis.. Heterotopic ossification is a process resulting in the formation of bone tissue that is often atypical, at an extraskeletal location. Calcification is often confused with ossification.\nThought 4: Ossification is the process of laying down new bone material.

Kales are considered to be closer to wild cabbage than most of the many domesticated forms of Brassica oleracea.[1] It is derived from wild mustard.[2].

Hammond first coined the term in 1879 when describing a case of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) exhibited in repeatedly washing one's hands.[3]. Common symptoms associated with mysophobia include abnormal behaviors such as excessive handwashing, wearing gloves or covering commonly used items to prevent contamination (without due reason), and avoiding social interaction or public spaces to avoid exposure to germs. Physical symptoms include common symptoms of anxiety such as lightheadedness, rapid heartbeat, sweating, and/or shaking in the presence of germs/contamination.[1]. Like many specific phobias, the exact causes of mysophobia are unknown.\nThought 4: Germaphobia is a pathological fear of contamination and germs, and it can cause physical symptoms such as lightheadedness and rapid heartbeat. Judo is a physical sport that involves close contact with others, so it is unlikely that a person with Germaphobia would be able to participate.\nAction 4: Finish[No]\nObservation 4: Episode finished, reward = 1\nThought 5: Let me check the uncertainty of the returned answer.\nAction 5: MeasureUncertainty [No]\nObservation 6: Answer’s uncertainty is 0.0, which falls within the acceptable threshold of 0.7.\nThought 6: Based on the uncertainty, answer is kept.\nAction 6: Keep Answer.\nAnswer: No"}
