In Norse mythology, the source of most surviving information about her, she is associated with marriage, prophecy, clairvoyance and motherhood, and dwells in the wetland halls of Fensalir. In wider Germanic mythology, she is known in Old High German as Frīja, in Langobardic as Frēa, in Old English as Frīg, in Old Frisian as Frīa, and in Old Saxon as Frī, all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym *Frijjō. Nearly all sources portray her as the wife of the god Odin.. In Old High German and Old Norse sources, she is specifically connected with Fulla, but she is also associated with the goddesses Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth, otherwise personified as an apparently separate entity Jörð (Old Norse: 'Earth').\nThought 5: Frigg is associated with Fulla.

Fulla is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in skaldic poetry. Volla (Folla) is attested in the \"Horse Cure\" Merseburg Incantation, recorded anonymously in the 10th century in Old High German, in which she assists in healing the wounded foal of Phol and is referred to as Frigg's sister.

The inaugural Games took place in 1896 in Athens, then part of the Kingdom of Greece, and the most recent was held in 2024 in Paris, France. This was the first international multi-sport event of its kind, organised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) founded by Pierre de Coubertin.[1] The tradition of awarding medals began in 1904; in each Olympic event, gold medals are awarded for first place, silver medals for second place, and bronze medals for third place. The Winter Olympic Games were created out of the success of the Summer Olympic Games, which are regarded as the largest and most prestigious multi-sport international event in the world.. The Summer Olympics have increased in scope from a 42-event competition programme in 1896 with fewer than 250 male competitors from 14 nations, to 339 events in 2021 (2020 Summer Olympics) with 11,319 competitors (almost half of whom were women) from 206 nations.\nThought 5: The Summer Olympic Games are held every four years.

Paris was the host city, with events (mainly football) held in 16 additional cities in metropolitan France, including the sailing centre in the second-largest city of France, Marseille, on the Mediterranean Sea, as well as one subsite for surfing in Tahiti, French Polynesia.[4]. Paris was awarded the Games at the 131st IOC Session in Lima, Peru, on 13 September 2017. After multiple withdrawals that left only Paris and Los Angeles in contention, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) approved a process to concurrently award the 2024 and 2028 Summer Olympics to the two remaining candidate cities; both bids were praised for their high technical plans and innovative ways to use a record-breaking number of existing and temporary facilities. Having previously hosted in 1900 and 1924, Paris became the second city ever to host the Summer Olympics three times (after London, which hosted the games in 1908, 1948, and 2012).[5][6] Paris 2024 marked the centenary of the 1924 games and the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix (the first Winter Olympics), as well as the sixth Olympic Games hosted by France (three Summer Olympics and three Winter Olympics) and the first with this distinction since the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville.\nThought 6: The 2024 Summer Olympics were held from 26 July to 11 August 2024.

Tokyo was selected as the host city during the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina on 7 September 2013.[3]. Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the Tokyo Games were postponed until 2021 on 24 March 2020 as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the first such instance in the history of the Olympic Games (some previous editions had been cancelled but not rescheduled).[4][5] However, the Tokyo 2020 branding was retained for marketing purposes.[6] The events were largely held behind closed doors with no public spectators permitted due to the declaration of a state of emergency in the Greater Tokyo Area in response to the pandemic, the only Olympic Games to be held without official spectators.[g] As a consequence of the postponement and the additional challenges caused by the pandemic, the 2020 Games were the most costly ever, with a total expenditure of over $20 billion.[8]. The 2020 Games were the fourth Olympics to be held in Japan, following the 1964 Summer Olympics (Tokyo), the 1972 Winter Olympics (Sapporo), and the 1998 Winter Olympics (Nagano). Tokyo became the first city in Asia to hold the Summer Olympic Games twice.[h] The 2020 Games were the second of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea and preceding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China.\nThought 7: The 2020 Summer Olympics were held from 23 July to 8 August 2020.

Rio de Janeiro was announced as the host city at the 121st IOC Session in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 2 October 2009.. 11,238 athletes from 207 nations took part in the 2016 Games, including first-time entrants Kosovo, South Sudan, and the Refugee Olympic Team.[3][4] With 306 sets of medals, the Games featured 28 Olympic sports, including rugby sevens and golf, which were added to the Olympic program in 2009. These sporting events took place at 33 venues in the host city and at five separate venues in the Brazilian cities of São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Brasília, and Manaus.. These were the first Olympic Games to be held in South America,[5] as well as the first to be held in a Portuguese-speaking country, the first summer edition to be held entirely in the host country's winter season, the first since 1968 to be held in Latin America, and the first since 2000 to be held in the Southern Hemisphere.[6] These were also the first Summer Olympics to take place under the International Olympic Committee (IOC) presidency of Thomas Bach.[4].\nThought 8: The 2016 Summer Olympics were held from 5 to 21 August 2016.

Some events were held at stadiums in Glasgow, Scotland and Cardiff, Wales.[3] The first event, the group stage in women's football, began on 25 July at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, followed by the opening ceremony on 27 July.[4][5] There were 10,518 athletes from 206 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) who participated in the 2012 Olympics.[6]. Following a bid headed by former Olympic champion Sebastian Coe and the then-London mayor Ken Livingstone, London was selected as the host city at the 117th IOC Session in Singapore on 6 July 2005, defeating bids from Moscow, New York City, Madrid, and Paris.[7] London became the first city to host the modern Olympics three times,[8][b] having previously hosted the Summer Games in 1908 and 1948.[9][10] Construction for the Games involved considerable redevelopment, with an emphasis on sustainability.[11] The main focus was a new 200-hectare (490-acre) Olympic Park, constructed on a former industrial site in Stratford, East London.[12] The Games also used venues that already existed before the bid.[13]. The United States topped the medal table, winning the most gold medals (48) and the highest number of medals overall (105).

The cemetery is one of only four officially existing within San Francisco city limits (the others being the Columbarium of San Francisco, the historic graveyard next to Mission Dolores, and the sarcophagus of Thomas Starr King)..

Hunchun has four subdistricts, four towns, and five townships.[6]. Since the early 1990s, the Chinese government invested significantly in transforming Hunchun into a regional economic center, thanks in large part to the influence of the former Jilin governor Wang Zhongyu, whose work with Zhu Rongji allowed him to become the first head of China's State Economic and Trade Commission.[9] On 9 March 1992 the Chinese parliament approved to set up Hunchun Border Economic Cooperation Zone.\nThought 4: Hunchun is a county-level city.

Shijiazhuang experienced dramatic growth after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. The population of the metropolitan area has more than quadrupled in thirty years as a result of industrialization and infrastructural developments.[7] From 2008 to 2011, Shijiazhuang implemented a three-year plan, resulting in an increase of green areas and new buildings and roads.

A society where justice has been achieved would be one in which individuals receive what they \"deserve\".

He influenced many artists, including Buddy Holly,[3] the Beatles, the Rolling Stones,[4] the Animals, George Thorogood, Syd Barrett,[5] and the Clash.[6]. His use of African rhythms and a signature beat, a simple five-accent hambone rhythm, is a cornerstone of hip hop, rock, and pop music.[4][7][8] In recognition of his achievements, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, the Blues Hall of Fame in 2003, and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2017.[9][7][10] He received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.[11] Diddley is also recognized for his technical innovations, including his use of tremolo and reverb effects to enhance the sound of his distinctive rectangular guitars.[12][13]. Bo Diddley was born in McComb, Mississippi,[nb 1] as Ellas Otha Bates (also stated as Otha Ellas Bates or Elias Otha Bates).[15] He was the only child of Ethel Wilson, a  sharecropper's teenaged daughter, and Eugene Bates,[16] whom he never knew. Wilson was only sixteen, and being unable to support a family, she gave her cousin, Gussie McDaniel,[17] permission to raise her son.[14] McDaniel eventually adopted him, and he assumed her surname.[18] Diddley vehemently denied ever having the name \"Otha\" in a 2001 interview, saying \"My name is not 'Otha'...\nThought 4: Bo Diddley's genre of music is blues, rock and roll, rhythm and blues, and pop music.

The band had a string of hits throughout the mid-1960s, including \"For Your Love\", \"Heart Full of Soul\", \"Shapes of Things\", and \"Over Under Sideways Down\".. Originally a blues-based band noted for their signature \"rave-up\" instrumental breaks,[6] the Yardbirds broadened their range into pop, pioneered psychedelic rock and early hard rock, and contributed to many electric guitar innovations of the mid-1960s. Some rock critics and historians also cite their influence on the later punk rock, progressive rock, and heavy metal trends.[7][6] Following the band's split in 1968, Relf and McCarty formed Renaissance, and Page formed Led Zeppelin.\nThought 5: The Yardbirds' genre of music is blues, pop, psychedelic rock, hard rock, and heavy metal.
