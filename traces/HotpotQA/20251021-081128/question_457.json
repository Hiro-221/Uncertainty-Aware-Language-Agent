      "full_prompt": "Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Action, Observation steps. Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be three types: \n(1) Search[entity], which searches the exact entity on Wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists. If not, it will return some similar entities to search.\n(2) Lookup[keyword], which returns the next sentence containing keyword in the current passage.\n(3) Finish[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.\nHere are some examples.\n\n\nQuestion: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?\nThought 1: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.\nAction 1: Search[Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.\nThought 2: It does not mention the eastern sector. So I need to look up eastern sector.\nAction 2: Lookup[eastern sector]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.\nThought 3: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.\nAction 3: Search[High Plains]\nObservation 3: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions:\nThought 4: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).\nAction 4: Search[High Plains (United States)]\nObservation 4: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]\nThought 5: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.\nAction 5: Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.\nAction 1: Search[Milhouse]\nObservation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up \"named after\".\nAction 2: Lookup[named after]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. \nThought 3: Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.\nAction 3: Finish[Richard Nixon]\nQuestion: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?\nThought 1: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.\nAction 1: Search[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 1: Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell].

In Norse mythology, the source of most surviving information about her, she is associated with marriage, prophecy, clairvoyance and motherhood, and dwells in the wetland halls of Fensalir. In wider Germanic mythology, she is known in Old High German as Frīja, in Langobardic as Frēa, in Old English as Frīg, in Old Frisian as Frīa, and in Old Saxon as Frī, all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym *Frijjō. Nearly all sources portray her as the wife of the god Odin.. In Old High German and Old Norse sources, she is specifically connected with Fulla, but she is also associated with the goddesses Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth, otherwise personified as an apparently separate entity Jörð (Old Norse: 'Earth').\nThought 3: Based on the above, I will provide an answer.\nAction 3: Finish[",

In wider Germanic mythology, she is known in Old High German as Frīja, in Langobardic as Frēa, in Old English as Frīg, in Old Frisian as Frīa, and in Old Saxon as Frī, all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym *Frijjō.

In Old High German and Old Norse sources, she is specifically connected with Fulla, but she is also associated with the goddesses Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth, otherwise personified as an apparently separate entity Jörð (Old Norse: 'Earth').",

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be three types: \n(1) Search[entity], which searches the exact entity on Wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists. If not, it will return some similar entities to search.\n(2) Lookup[keyword], which returns the next sentence containing keyword in the current passage.\n(3) Finish[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.\nHere are some examples.\n\n\nQuestion: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?\nThought 1: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.\nAction 1: Search[Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.\nThought 2: It does not mention the eastern sector. So I need to look up eastern sector.\nAction 2: Lookup[eastern sector]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.\nThought 3: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.\nAction 3: Search[High Plains]\nObservation 3: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions:\nThought 4: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).\nAction 4: Search[High Plains (United States)]\nObservation 4: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]\nThought 5: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.\nAction 5: Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.\nAction 1: Search[Milhouse]\nObservation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up \"named after\".\nAction 2: Lookup[named after]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. \nThought 3: Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.\nAction 3: Finish[Richard Nixon]\nQuestion: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?\nThought 1: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.\nAction 1: Search[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 1: Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell]. Similar: ['Adam Clayton Powell III', 'Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)', 'Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building', 'Isabel Washington Powell', 'Adam Powell', 'Adam Clayton Powell (film)', 'Giancarlo Esposito'].\nThought 2: To find the documentary, I can search Adam Clayton Powell (film).\nAction 2: Search[Adam Clayton Powell (film)]\nObservation 2: Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Richard Kilberg.\nThe film is about the rise and fall of influential African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired as part of the PBS series The American Experience.\nThought 3: Adam Clayton Powell (film) is a documentary about an African-American politician, not Finnish rock groups. So the documentary about Finnish rock groups must instead be The Saimaa Gesture.\nAction 3: Finish[The Saimaa Gesture]\nQuestion: What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?\nThought 1: I need to search Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, find their professions, then find the profession they have in common.\nAction 1: Search[Nicholas Ray]\nObservation 1: Nicholas Ray (born Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr., August 7, 1911 – June 16, 1979) was an American film director, screenwriter, and actor best known for the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause.\nThought 2: Professions of Nicholas Ray are director, screenwriter, and actor. I need to search Elia Kazan next and find his professions.\nAction 2: Search[Elia Kazan]\nObservation 2: Elia Kazan was an American film and theatre director, producer, screenwriter and actor.\nThought 3: Professions of Elia Kazan are director, producer, screenwriter, and actor. So profession Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common is director, screenwriter, and actor.\nAction 3: Finish[director, screenwriter, actor]\nQuestion: Which magazine was started first Arthur's Magazine or First for Women?\nThought 1: I need to search Arthur's Magazine and First for Women, and find which was started first.\nAction 1: Search[Arthur's Magazine]\nObservation 1: Arthur's Magazine (1844-1846) was an American literary periodical published in Philadelphia in the 19th century. \nThought 2: Arthur's Magazine was started in 1844. I need to search First for Women next.\nAction 2: Search[First for Women]\nObservation 2: First for Women is a woman's magazine published by Bauer Media Group in the USA.[1] The magazine was started in 1989. \nThought 3: First for Women was started in 1989. 1844 (Arthur's Magazine) < 1989 (First for Women), so Arthur's Magazine was started first.\nAction 3: Finish[Arthur's Magazine]\nQuestion: Were Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin known for the same type of work?\nThought 1: I need to search Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin, find their types of work, then find if they are the same.\nAction 1: Search[Pavel Urysohn]\nObservation 1: Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn (February 3, 1898 â August 17, 1924) was a Soviet mathematician who is best known for his contributions in dimension theory.\nThought 2: Pavel Urysohn is a mathematician. I need to search Leonid Levin next and find its type of work.\nAction 2: Search[Leonid Levin]\nObservation 2: Leonid Anatolievich Levin is a Soviet-American mathematician and computer scientist. \nThought 3: Leonid Levin is a mathematician and computer scientist.

Similar: ['Frigg', 'Frigg and Freyja common origin hypothesis', 'Freyja (redirect from Freia (goddess))', 'Fensalir (category Frigg)', 'Baldr'].\nThought 2: To find the goddess associated with the goddess frigg, I can search Frigg.\nAction 2: Search[Frigg]\nObservation 2: Frigg (/frɪɡ/; Old Norse: [ˈfriɡː])[1] is a goddess, one of the Æsir, in Germanic mythology. In Norse mythology, the source of most surviving information about her, she is associated with marriage, prophecy, clairvoyance and motherhood, and dwells in the wetland halls of Fensalir. In wider Germanic mythology, she is known in Old High German as Frīja, in Langobardic as Frēa, in Old English as Frīg, in Old Frisian as Frīa, and in Old Saxon as Frī, all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym *Frijjō. Nearly all sources portray her as the wife of the god Odin.. In Old High German and Old Norse sources, she is specifically connected with Fulla, but she is also associated with the goddesses Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth, otherwise personified as an apparently separate entity Jörð (Old Norse: 'Earth').\nThought 3: Frigg is associated with Fulla, Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth. So the goddess associated with the goddess frigg is Fulla, Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth. I need to search Fulla, Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth next and find what tales they consist of.\nAction 3: Search[Fulla]\nObservation 3: Fulla (Old Norse: [ˈfulːɑ], possibly 'bountiful') or Volla (Old High German, 'plenitude') is a goddess in Germanic mythology. In Norse mythology, Fulla is described as wearing a golden band and as tending to the ashen box and the footwear owned by the goddess Frigg, and, in addition, Frigg confides in Fulla her secrets. Fulla is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in skaldic poetry. Volla (Folla) is attested in the \"Horse Cure\" Merseburg Incantation, recorded anonymously in the 10th century in Old High German, in which she assists in healing the wounded foal of Phol and is referred to as Frigg's sister. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess..\nThought 4: Based on the above, I will provide an answer.\nAction 4: Finish[",

So I need to look up eastern sector.\nAction 2: Lookup[eastern sector]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.\nThought 3: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.\nAction 3: Search[High Plains]\nObservation 3: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions:\nThought 4: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).\nAction 4: Search[High Plains (United States)]\nObservation 4: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]\nThought 5: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.\nAction 5: Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.\nAction 1: Search[Milhouse]\nObservation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up \"named after\".\nAction 2: Lookup[named after]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. \nThought 3: Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.\nAction 3: Finish[Richard Nixon]\nQuestion: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?\nThought 1: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.\nAction 1: Search[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 1: Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell]. Similar: ['Adam Clayton Powell III', 'Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)', 'Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building', 'Isabel Washington Powell', 'Adam Powell', 'Adam Clayton Powell (film)', 'Giancarlo Esposito'].\nThought 2: To find the documentary, I can search Adam Clayton Powell (film).\nAction 2: Search[Adam Clayton Powell (film)]\nObservation 2: Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Richard Kilberg.\nThe film is about the rise and fall of influential African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired as part of the PBS series The American Experience.\nThought 3: Adam Clayton Powell (film) is a documentary about an African-American politician, not Finnish rock groups.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be three types: \n(1) Search[entity], which searches the exact entity on Wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists. If not, it will return some similar entities to search.\n(2) Lookup[keyword], which returns the next sentence containing keyword in the current passage.\n(3) Finish[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.\nHere are some examples.\n\n\nQuestion: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?\nThought 1: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.\nAction 1: Search[Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.\nThought 2: It does not mention the eastern sector. So I need to look up eastern sector.\nAction 2: Lookup[eastern sector]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.\nThought 3: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.\nAction 3: Search[High Plains]\nObservation 3: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions:\nThought 4: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).\nAction 4: Search[High Plains (United States)]\nObservation 4: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]\nThought 5: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.\nAction 5: Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.\nAction 1: Search[Milhouse]\nObservation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up \"named after\".\nAction 2: Lookup[named after]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. \nThought 3: Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.\nAction 3: Finish[Richard Nixon]\nQuestion: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?\nThought 1: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.\nAction 1: Search[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 1: Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell]. Similar: ['Adam Clayton Powell III', 'Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)', 'Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building', 'Isabel Washington Powell', 'Adam Powell', 'Adam Clayton Powell (film)', 'Giancarlo Esposito'].\nThought 2: To find the documentary, I can search Adam Clayton Powell (film).\nAction 2: Search[Adam Clayton Powell (film)]\nObservation 2: Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Richard Kilberg.\nThe film is about the rise and fall of influential African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired as part of the PBS series The American Experience.\nThought 3: Adam Clayton Powell (film) is a documentary about an African-American politician, not Finnish rock groups.

I need to search First for Women next.\nAction 2: Search[First for Women]\nObservation 2: First for Women is a woman's magazine published by Bauer Media Group in the USA.[1] The magazine was started in 1989. \nThought 3: First for Women was started in 1989. 1844 (Arthur's Magazine) < 1989 (First for Women), so Arthur's Magazine was started first.\nAction 3: Finish[Arthur's Magazine]\nQuestion: Were Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin known for the same type of work?\nThought 1: I need to search Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin, find their types of work, then find if they are the same.\nAction 1: Search[Pavel Urysohn]\nObservation 1: Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn (February 3, 1898 â August 17, 1924) was a Soviet mathematician who is best known for his contributions in dimension theory.\nThought 2: Pavel Urysohn is a mathematician.

Similar: ['Frigg', 'Frigg and Freyja common origin hypothesis', 'Freyja (redirect from Freia (goddess))', 'Fensalir (category Frigg)', 'Baldr'].\nThought 2: To find the goddess associated with the goddess frigg, I can search Frigg.\nAction 2: Search[Frigg]\nObservation 2: Frigg (/frɪɡ/; Old Norse: [ˈfriɡː])[1] is a goddess, one of the Æsir, in Germanic mythology. In Norse mythology, the source of most surviving information about her, she is associated with marriage, prophecy, clairvoyance and motherhood, and dwells in the wetland halls of Fensalir. In wider Germanic mythology, she is known in Old High German as Frīja, in Langobardic as Frēa, in Old English as Frīg, in Old Frisian as Frīa, and in Old Saxon as Frī, all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym *Frijjō. Nearly all sources portray her as the wife of the god Odin.. In Old High German and Old Norse sources, she is specifically connected with Fulla, but she is also associated with the goddesses Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth, otherwise personified as an apparently separate entity Jörð (Old Norse: 'Earth').\nThought 3: Frigg is associated with Fulla, Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth. So the goddess associated with the goddess frigg is Fulla, Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth. I need to search Fulla, Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth next and find what tales they consist of.\nAction 3: Search[Fulla]\nObservation 3: Fulla (Old Norse: [ˈfulːɑ], possibly 'bountiful') or Volla (Old High German, 'plenitude') is a goddess in Germanic mythology. In Norse mythology, Fulla is described as wearing a golden band and as tending to the ashen box and the footwear owned by the goddess Frigg, and, in addition, Frigg confides in Fulla her secrets. Fulla is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in skaldic poetry. Volla (Folla) is attested in the \"Horse Cure\" Merseburg Incantation, recorded anonymously in the 10th century in Old High German, in which she assists in healing the wounded foal of Phol and is referred to as Frigg's sister. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess..\nThought 4: Fulla is described as wearing a golden band and as tending to the ashen box and the footwear owned by the goddess Frigg, and, in addition, Frigg confides in Fulla her secrets. So Fulla consists of the tales of wearing a golden band, tending to the ashen box and the footwear owned by the goddess Frigg, and Frigg confiding in Fulla her secrets. I need to search Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth next and find what tales they consist of.\nAction 4: Search[Lofn]\nObservation 4: In Norse mythology, Lofn (Old Norse: [ˈlovn], possibly \"comforter,\"[1] \"the comforter, the mild,\"[2] or \"loving\"[3]) is a goddess. Lofn is attested in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson and in kennings found in skaldic poetry. In the Prose Edda, Lofn is described as gentle in manner and as an arranger of marriages, even when they have been forbidden. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess.. In chapter 35 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, High provides brief descriptions of 16 ásynjur.\nThought 5: Based on the above, I will provide an answer.\nAction 5: Finish[",

In Norse mythology, the source of most surviving information about her, she is associated with marriage, prophecy, clairvoyance and motherhood, and dwells in the wetland halls of Fensalir. In wider Germanic mythology, she is known in Old High German as Frīja, in Langobardic as Frēa, in Old English as Frīg, in Old Frisian as Frīa, and in Old Saxon as Frī, all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym *Frijjō. Nearly all sources portray her as the wife of the god Odin.. In Old High German and Old Norse sources, she is specifically connected with Fulla, but she is also associated with the goddesses Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth, otherwise personified as an apparently separate entity Jörð (Old Norse: 'Earth').\nThought 3: Frigg is associated with Fulla, Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth. So the goddess associated with the goddess frigg is Fulla, Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth. I need to search Fulla, Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth next and find what tales they consist of.\nAction 3: Search[Fulla]\nObservation 3: Fulla (Old Norse: [ˈfulːɑ], possibly 'bountiful') or Volla (Old High German, 'plenitude') is a goddess in Germanic mythology. In Norse mythology, Fulla is described as wearing a golden band and as tending to the ashen box and the footwear owned by the goddess Frigg, and, in addition, Frigg confides in Fulla her secrets. Fulla is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in skaldic poetry. Volla (Folla) is attested in the \"Horse Cure\" Merseburg Incantation, recorded anonymously in the 10th century in Old High German, in which she assists in healing the wounded foal of Phol and is referred to as Frigg's sister. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess..\nThought 4: Fulla is described as wearing a golden band and as tending to the ashen box and the footwear owned by the goddess Frigg, and, in addition, Frigg confides in Fulla her secrets. So Fulla consists of the tales of wearing a golden band, tending to the ashen box and the footwear owned by the goddess Frigg, and Frigg confiding in Fulla her secrets. I need to search Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth next and find what tales they consist of.\nAction 4: Search[Lofn]\nObservation 4: In Norse mythology, Lofn (Old Norse: [ˈlovn], possibly \"comforter,\"[1] \"the comforter, the mild,\"[2] or \"loving\"[3]) is a goddess. Lofn is attested in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson and in kennings found in skaldic poetry. In the Prose Edda, Lofn is described as gentle in manner and as an arranger of marriages, even when they have been forbidden. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess.. In chapter 35 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, High provides brief descriptions of 16 ásynjur.\nThought 5: Lofn is gentle in manner and as an arranger of marriages, even when they have been forbidden. So Lofn consists of the tales of being gentle in manner and as an arranger of marriages, even when they have been forbidden. I need to search Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth next and find what tales they consist of.\nAction 5: Search[Hlín]\nObservation 5: In Norse mythology, Hlín is a goddess associated with the goddess Frigg. Hlín appears in a poem in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and in kennings found in skaldic poetry. Scholars have debated whether the stanza referring to her in the Prose Edda refers to Frigg. Hlín serves as a given name in Iceland, and Hlín receives veneration in the modern era in Germanic paganism's modern extension, Heathenry.. Scholars frequently explain the meaning behind the goddess's name as 'protector'.[1] The Prose Edda section Gylfaginning derives the name from a verb found in a proverb in an obscure and otherwise unattested Old Norse proverb: Þiaðan af er þat orðtak at sá er forðask hleinir.\nThought 6: Based on the above, I will provide an answer.\nAction 6: Finish[",

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be three types: \n(1) Search[entity], which searches the exact entity on Wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists. If not, it will return some similar entities to search.\n(2) Lookup[keyword], which returns the next sentence containing keyword in the current passage.\n(3) Finish[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.\nHere are some examples.\n\n\nQuestion: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?\nThought 1: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.\nAction 1: Search[Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.\nThought 2: It does not mention the eastern sector. So I need to look up eastern sector.\nAction 2: Lookup[eastern sector]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.\nThought 3: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.\nAction 3: Search[High Plains]\nObservation 3: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions:\nThought 4: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).\nAction 4: Search[High Plains (United States)]\nObservation 4: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]\nThought 5: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.\nAction 5: Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.\nAction 1: Search[Milhouse]\nObservation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up \"named after\".\nAction 2: Lookup[named after]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. \nThought 3: Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.\nAction 3: Finish[Richard Nixon]\nQuestion: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?\nThought 1: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.\nAction 1: Search[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 1: Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell]. Similar: ['Adam Clayton Powell III', 'Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)', 'Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building', 'Isabel Washington Powell', 'Adam Powell', 'Adam Clayton Powell (film)', 'Giancarlo Esposito'].\nThought 2: To find the documentary, I can search Adam Clayton Powell (film).\nAction 2: Search[Adam Clayton Powell (film)]\nObservation 2: Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Richard Kilberg.\nThe film is about the rise and fall of influential African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired as part of the PBS series The American Experience.\nThought 3: Adam Clayton Powell (film) is a documentary about an African-American politician, not Finnish rock groups. So the documentary about Finnish rock groups must instead be The Saimaa Gesture.\nAction 3: Finish[The Saimaa Gesture]\nQuestion: What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?\nThought 1: I need to search Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, find their professions, then find the profession they have in common.\nAction 1: Search[Nicholas Ray]\nObservation 1: Nicholas Ray (born Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr., August 7, 1911 – June 16, 1979) was an American film director, screenwriter, and actor best known for the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause.\nThought 2: Professions of Nicholas Ray are director, screenwriter, and actor.

So profession Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common is director, screenwriter, and actor.\nAction 3: Finish[director, screenwriter, actor]\nQuestion: Which magazine was started first Arthur's Magazine or First for Women?\nThought 1: I need to search Arthur's Magazine and First for Women, and find which was started first.\nAction 1: Search[Arthur's Magazine]\nObservation 1: Arthur's Magazine (1844-1846) was an American literary periodical published in Philadelphia in the 19th century. \nThought 2: Arthur's Magazine was started in 1844. I need to search First for Women next.\nAction 2: Search[First for Women]\nObservation 2: First for Women is a woman's magazine published by Bauer Media Group in the USA.[1] The magazine was started in 1989. \nThought 3: First for Women was started in 1989. 1844 (Arthur's Magazine) < 1989 (First for Women), so Arthur's Magazine was started first.\nAction 3: Finish[Arthur's Magazine]\nQuestion: Were Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin known for the same type of work?\nThought 1: I need to search Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin, find their types of work, then find if they are the same.\nAction 1: Search[Pavel Urysohn]\nObservation 1: Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn (February 3, 1898 â August 17, 1924) was a Soviet mathematician who is best known for his contributions in dimension theory.\nThought 2: Pavel Urysohn is a mathematician. I need to search Leonid Levin next and find its type of work.\nAction 2: Search[Leonid Levin]\nObservation 2: Leonid Anatolievich Levin is a Soviet-American mathematician and computer scientist. \nThought 3: Leonid Levin is a mathematician and computer scientist. So Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin have the same type of work. \nAction 3: Finish[yes]\nQuestion: What does the goddess associated with the goddess frigg  consists of what tales?\nThought 1: I need to search goddess frigg, find the goddess associated with the goddess frigg, then find what tales it consists of.\nAction 1: Search[goddess frigg]\nObservation 1: Could not find goddess frigg. Similar: ['Frigg', 'Frigg and Freyja common origin hypothesis', 'Freyja (redirect from Freia (goddess))', 'Fensalir (category Frigg)', 'Baldr'].\nThought 2: To find the goddess associated with the goddess frigg, I can search Frigg.\nAction 2: Search[Frigg]\nObservation 2: Frigg (/frɪɡ/; Old Norse: [ˈfriɡː])[1] is a goddess, one of the Æsir, in Germanic mythology. In Norse mythology, the source of most surviving information about her, she is associated with marriage, prophecy, clairvoyance and motherhood, and dwells in the wetland halls of Fensalir. In wider Germanic mythology, she is known in Old High German as Frīja, in Langobardic as Frēa, in Old English as Frīg, in Old Frisian as Frīa, and in Old Saxon as Frī, all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym *Frijjō. Nearly all sources portray her as the wife of the god Odin.. In Old High German and Old Norse sources, she is specifically connected with Fulla, but she is also associated with the goddesses Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth, otherwise personified as an apparently separate entity Jörð (Old Norse: 'Earth').\nThought 3: Frigg is associated with Fulla, Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth. So the goddess associated with the goddess frigg is Fulla, Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth. I need to search Fulla, Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth next and find what tales they consist of.\nAction 3: Search[Fulla]\nObservation 3: Fulla (Old Norse: [ˈfulːɑ], possibly 'bountiful') or Volla (Old High German, 'plenitude') is a goddess in Germanic mythology. In Norse mythology, Fulla is described as wearing a golden band and as tending to the ashen box and the footwear owned by the goddess Frigg, and, in addition, Frigg confides in Fulla her secrets. Fulla is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in skaldic poetry. Volla (Folla) is attested in the \"Horse Cure\" Merseburg Incantation, recorded anonymously in the 10th century in Old High German, in which she assists in healing the wounded foal of Phol and is referred to as Frigg's sister. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess..\nThought 4: Fulla is described as wearing a golden band and as tending to the ashen box and the footwear owned by the goddess Frigg, and, in addition, Frigg confides in Fulla her secrets. So Fulla consists of the tales of wearing a golden band, tending to the ashen box and the footwear owned by the goddess Frigg, and Frigg confiding in Fulla her secrets. I need to search Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth next and find what tales they consist of.\nAction 4: Search[Lofn]\nObservation 4: In Norse mythology, Lofn (Old Norse: [ˈlovn], possibly \"comforter,\"[1] \"the comforter, the mild,\"[2] or \"loving\"[3]) is a goddess. Lofn is attested in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson and in kennings found in skaldic poetry. In the Prose Edda, Lofn is described as gentle in manner and as an arranger of marriages, even when they have been forbidden. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess.. In chapter 35 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, High provides brief descriptions of 16 ásynjur.\nThought 5: Lofn is gentle in manner and as an arranger of marriages, even when they have been forbidden. So Lofn consists of the tales of being gentle in manner and as an arranger of marriages, even when they have been forbidden. I need to search Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth next and find what tales they consist of.\nAction 5: Search[Hlín]\nObservation 5: In Norse mythology, Hlín is a goddess associated with the goddess Frigg. Hlín appears in a poem in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and in kennings found in skaldic poetry. Scholars have debated whether the stanza referring to her in the Prose Edda refers to Frigg. Hlín serves as a given name in Iceland, and Hlín receives veneration in the modern era in Germanic paganism's modern extension, Heathenry.. Scholars frequently explain the meaning behind the goddess's name as 'protector'.[1] The Prose Edda section Gylfaginning derives the name from a verb found in a proverb in an obscure and otherwise unattested Old Norse proverb: Þiaðan af er þat orðtak at sá er forðask hleinir.\nThought 6: Hlín is a goddess associated with the goddess Frigg. So Hlín consists of the tales of being a goddess associated with the goddess Frigg. I need to search Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth next and find what tales they consist of.\nAction 6: Search[Gná]\nObservation 6: In Norse mythology, Gná (Old Norse) is a goddess who runs errands in other worlds for the goddess Frigg and rides the flying, sea-treading horse Hófvarpnir (Old Norse \"he who throws his hoofs about\",[1] \"hoof-thrower\"[2] or \"hoof kicker\"[3]). Gná and Hófvarpnir are attested in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Scholarly have proposed that Gná is a \"goddess of fullness\" and, in the 1800s, as potentially cognate to Fama from Roman mythology. Hófvarpnir and the eight-legged steed Sleipnir have been cited examples of transcendent horses in Norse mythology.. In chapter 35 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, the enthroned figure of High provides brief descriptions of 16 ásynjur.\nThought 7: Based on the above, I will provide an answer.\nAction 7: Finish[",

In Norse mythology, the source of most surviving information about her, she is associated with marriage, prophecy, clairvoyance and motherhood, and dwells in the wetland halls of Fensalir. In wider Germanic mythology, she is known in Old High German as Frīja, in Langobardic as Frēa, in Old English as Frīg, in Old Frisian as Frīa, and in Old Saxon as Frī, all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym *Frijjō. Nearly all sources portray her as the wife of the god Odin.. In Old High German and Old Norse sources, she is specifically connected with Fulla, but she is also associated with the goddesses Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth, otherwise personified as an apparently separate entity Jörð (Old Norse: 'Earth').\nThought 3: Frigg is associated with Fulla, Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth. So the goddess associated with the goddess frigg is Fulla, Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth.

In Norse mythology, Fulla is described as wearing a golden band and as tending to the ashen box and the footwear owned by the goddess Frigg, and, in addition, Frigg confides in Fulla her secrets. Fulla is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in skaldic poetry. Volla (Folla) is attested in the \"Horse Cure\" Merseburg Incantation, recorded anonymously in the 10th century in Old High German, in which she assists in healing the wounded foal of Phol and is referred to as Frigg's sister. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess..\nThought 4: Fulla is described as wearing a golden band and as tending to the ashen box and the footwear owned by the goddess Frigg, and, in addition, Frigg confides in Fulla her secrets. So Fulla consists of the tales of wearing a golden band, tending to the ashen box and the footwear owned by the goddess Frigg, and Frigg confiding in Fulla her secrets. I need to search Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth next and find what tales they consist of.\nAction 4: Search[Lofn]\nObservation 4: In Norse mythology, Lofn (Old Norse: [ˈlovn], possibly \"comforter,\"[1] \"the comforter, the mild,\"[2] or \"loving\"[3]) is a goddess. Lofn is attested in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson and in kennings found in skaldic poetry. In the Prose Edda, Lofn is described as gentle in manner and as an arranger of marriages, even when they have been forbidden. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess.. In chapter 35 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, High provides brief descriptions of 16 ásynjur.\nThought 5: Lofn is gentle in manner and as an arranger of marriages, even when they have been forbidden. So Lofn consists of the tales of being gentle in manner and as an arranger of marriages, even when they have been forbidden. I need to search Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth next and find what tales they consist of.\nAction 5: Search[Hlín]\nObservation 5: In Norse mythology, Hlín is a goddess associated with the goddess Frigg. Hlín appears in a poem in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and in kennings found in skaldic poetry. Scholars have debated whether the stanza referring to her in the Prose Edda refers to Frigg. Hlín serves as a given name in Iceland, and Hlín receives veneration in the modern era in Germanic paganism's modern extension, Heathenry.. Scholars frequently explain the meaning behind the goddess's name as 'protector'.[1] The Prose Edda section Gylfaginning derives the name from a verb found in a proverb in an obscure and otherwise unattested Old Norse proverb: Þiaðan af er þat orðtak at sá er forðask hleinir.\nThought 6: Hlín is a goddess associated with the goddess Frigg. So Hlín consists of the tales of being a goddess associated with the goddess Frigg. I need to search Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth next and find what tales they consist of.\nAction 6: Search[Gná]\nObservation 6: In Norse mythology, Gná (Old Norse) is a goddess who runs errands in other worlds for the goddess Frigg and rides the flying, sea-treading horse Hófvarpnir (Old Norse \"he who throws his hoofs about\",[1] \"hoof-thrower\"[2] or \"hoof kicker\"[3]).

I need to search Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth next and find what tales they consist of.\nAction 5: Search[Hlín]\nObservation 5: In Norse mythology, Hlín is a goddess associated with the goddess Frigg. Hlín appears in a poem in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and in kennings found in skaldic poetry. Scholars have debated whether the stanza referring to her in the Prose Edda refers to Frigg. Hlín serves as a given name in Iceland, and Hlín receives veneration in the modern era in Germanic paganism's modern extension, Heathenry.. Scholars frequently explain the meaning behind the goddess's name as 'protector'.[1] The Prose Edda section Gylfaginning derives the name from a verb found in a proverb in an obscure and otherwise unattested Old Norse proverb: Þiaðan af er þat orðtak at sá er forðask hleinir.\nThought 6: Hlín is a goddess associated with the goddess Frigg. So Hlín consists of the tales of being a goddess associated with the goddess Frigg. I need to search Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth next and find what tales they consist of.\nAction 6: Search[Gná]\nObservation 6: In Norse mythology, Gná (Old Norse) is a goddess who runs errands in other worlds for the goddess Frigg and rides the flying, sea-treading horse Hófvarpnir (Old Norse \"he who throws his hoofs about\",[1] \"hoof-thrower\"[2] or \"hoof kicker\"[3]). Gná and Hófvarpnir are attested in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Scholarly have proposed that Gná is a \"goddess of fullness\" and, in the 1800s, as potentially cognate to Fama from Roman mythology. Hófvarpnir and the eight-legged steed Sleipnir have been cited examples of transcendent horses in Norse mythology.. In chapter 35 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, the enthroned figure of High provides brief descriptions of 16 ásynjur.\nThought 7:",

So I need to look up eastern sector.\nAction 2: Lookup[eastern sector]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.\nThought 3: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.\nAction 3: Search[High Plains]\nObservation 3: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions:\nThought 4: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).\nAction 4: Search[High Plains (United States)]\nObservation 4: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]\nThought 5: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.\nAction 5: Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.\nAction 1: Search[Milhouse]\nObservation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up \"named after\".\nAction 2: Lookup[named after]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. \nThought 3: Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.\nAction 3: Finish[Richard Nixon]\nQuestion: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?\nThought 1: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.\nAction 1: Search[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 1: Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell]. Similar: ['Adam Clayton Powell III', 'Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)', 'Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building', 'Isabel Washington Powell', 'Adam Powell', 'Adam Clayton Powell (film)', 'Giancarlo Esposito'].\nThought 2: To find the documentary, I can search Adam Clayton Powell (film).\nAction 2: Search[Adam Clayton Powell (film)]\nObservation 2: Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Richard Kilberg.\nThe film is about the rise and fall of influential African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired as part of the PBS series The American Experience.\nThought 3: Adam Clayton Powell (film) is a documentary about an African-American politician, not Finnish rock groups. So the documentary about Finnish rock groups must instead be The Saimaa Gesture.\nAction 3: Finish[The Saimaa Gesture]\nQuestion: What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?\nThought 1: I need to search Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, find their professions, then find the profession they have in common.\nAction 1: Search[Nicholas Ray]\nObservation 1: Nicholas Ray (born Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr., August 7, 1911 – June 16, 1979) was an American film director, screenwriter, and actor best known for the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause.\nThought 2: Professions of Nicholas Ray are director, screenwriter, and actor.

Similar: ['Frigg', 'Frigg and Freyja common origin hypothesis', 'Freyja (redirect from Freia (goddess))', 'Fensalir (category Frigg)', 'Baldr'].\nThought 2: To find the goddess associated with the goddess frigg, I can search Frigg.\nAction 2: Search[Frigg]\nObservation 2: Frigg (/frɪɡ/; Old Norse: [ˈfriɡː])[1] is a goddess, one of the Æsir, in Germanic mythology. In Norse mythology, the source of most surviving information about her, she is associated with marriage, prophecy, clairvoyance and motherhood, and dwells in the wetland halls of Fensalir. In wider Germanic mythology, she is known in Old High German as Frīja, in Langobardic as Frēa, in Old English as Frīg, in Old Frisian as Frīa, and in Old Saxon as Frī, all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym *Frijjō. Nearly all sources portray her as the wife of the god Odin.. In Old High German and Old Norse sources, she is specifically connected with Fulla, but she is also associated with the goddesses Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth, otherwise personified as an apparently separate entity Jörð (Old Norse: 'Earth').\nThought 3: Frigg is associated with Fulla, Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth. So the goddess associated with the goddess frigg is Fulla, Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth. I need to search Fulla, Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth next and find what tales they consist of.\nAction 3: Search[Fulla]\nObservation 3: Fulla (Old Norse: [ˈfulːɑ], possibly 'bountiful') or Volla (Old High German, 'plenitude') is a goddess in Germanic mythology. In Norse mythology, Fulla is described as wearing a golden band and as tending to the ashen box and the footwear owned by the goddess Frigg, and, in addition, Frigg confides in Fulla her secrets. Fulla is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in skaldic poetry. Volla (Folla) is attested in the \"Horse Cure\" Merseburg Incantation, recorded anonymously in the 10th century in Old High German, in which she assists in healing the wounded foal of Phol and is referred to as Frigg's sister. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess..\nThought 4: Fulla is described as wearing a golden band and as tending to the ashen box and the footwear owned by the goddess Frigg, and, in addition, Frigg confides in Fulla her secrets. So Fulla consists of the tales of wearing a golden band, tending to the ashen box and the footwear owned by the goddess Frigg, and Frigg confiding in Fulla her secrets. I need to search Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth next and find what tales they consist of.\nAction 4: Search[Lofn]\nObservation 4: In Norse mythology, Lofn (Old Norse: [ˈlovn], possibly \"comforter,\"[1] \"the comforter, the mild,\"[2] or \"loving\"[3]) is a goddess. Lofn is attested in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson and in kennings found in skaldic poetry. In the Prose Edda, Lofn is described as gentle in manner and as an arranger of marriages, even when they have been forbidden. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess.. In chapter 35 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, High provides brief descriptions of 16 ásynjur.\nThought 5: Lofn is gentle in manner and as an arranger of marriages, even when they have been forbidden. So Lofn consists of the tales of being gentle in manner and as an arranger of marriages, even when they have been forbidden. I need to search Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth next and find what tales they consist of.\nAction 5: Search[Hlín]\nObservation 5: In Norse mythology, Hlín is a goddess associated with the goddess Frigg. Hlín appears in a poem in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and in kennings found in skaldic poetry. Scholars have debated whether the stanza referring to her in the Prose Edda refers to Frigg. Hlín serves as a given name in Iceland, and Hlín receives veneration in the modern era in Germanic paganism's modern extension, Heathenry.. Scholars frequently explain the meaning behind the goddess's name as 'protector'.[1] The Prose Edda section Gylfaginning derives the name from a verb found in a proverb in an obscure and otherwise unattested Old Norse proverb: Þiaðan af er þat orðtak at sá er forðask hleinir.\nThought 6: Hlín is a goddess associated with the goddess Frigg. So Hlín consists of the tales of being a goddess associated with the goddess Frigg. I need to search Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth next and find what tales they consist of.\nAction 6: Search[Gná]\nObservation 6: In Norse mythology, Gná (Old Norse) is a goddess who runs errands in other worlds for the goddess Frigg and rides the flying, sea-treading horse Hófvarpnir (Old Norse \"he who throws his hoofs about\",[1] \"hoof-thrower\"[2] or \"hoof kicker\"[3]). Gná and Hófvarpnir are attested in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Scholarly have proposed that Gná is a \"goddess of fullness\" and, in the 1800s, as potentially cognate to Fama from Roman mythology. Hófvarpnir and the eight-legged steed Sleipnir have been cited examples of transcendent horses in Norse mythology.. In chapter 35 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, the enthroned figure of High provides brief descriptions of 16 ásynjur.\nThought 7: Gná runs errands in other worlds for the goddess Frigg and rides the flying, sea-treading horse Hófvarpnir. So Gná consists of the tales of running errands in other worlds for the goddess Frigg and riding the flying, sea-treading horse Hófvarpnir. I need to search ambiguously with the Earth next and find what tales it consists of.\nAction 7: Search[ambiguously with the Earth]\nObservation 7: Could not find ambiguously with the Earth. Similar: ['Frigg (category Articles with short description)', 'Earth', 'The Ambiguously Gay Duo', \"Tolkien's ambiguity\", 'Flat Earth'].\nThought 8: Based on the above, I will provide an answer.\nAction 8: Finish[",

  "traj": "Question: What does the goddess associated with the goddess frigg  consists of what tales?\nThought 1:Let's think step by step. The goddess associated with the goddess frigg is Frigg. Frigg consists of the tales of the goddess Frigg.\nAnswer: The tales of the goddess Frigg\nAction 1: MeasureUncertainty [The tales of the goddess Frigg]\nObservation 1: Answer’s uncertainty is 2.08, which falls outside the acceptable threshold of 1.79.\nThought 2: Based on the uncertainty, I need to use an external tool to solve the question.\nAction 2: Activate Tool.\nThought 3: I need to search goddess frigg, find the goddess associated with the goddess frigg, then find what tales it consists of.\nAction 3: Search[goddess frigg]\nObservation 3: Could not find goddess frigg. Similar: ['Frigg', 'Frigg and Freyja common origin hypothesis', 'Freyja (redirect from Freia (goddess))', 'Fensalir (category Frigg)', 'Baldr'].\nThought 4: To find the goddess associated with the goddess frigg, I can search Frigg.\nAction 4: Search[Frigg]\nObservation 4: Frigg (/frɪɡ/; Old Norse: [ˈfriɡː])[1] is a goddess, one of the Æsir, in Germanic mythology. In Norse mythology, the source of most surviving information about her, she is associated with marriage, prophecy, clairvoyance and motherhood, and dwells in the wetland halls of Fensalir. In wider Germanic mythology, she is known in Old High German as Frīja, in Langobardic as Frēa, in Old English as Frīg, in Old Frisian as Frīa, and in Old Saxon as Frī, all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym *Frijjō. Nearly all sources portray her as the wife of the god Odin.. In Old High German and Old Norse sources, she is specifically connected with Fulla, but she is also associated with the goddesses Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth, otherwise personified as an apparently separate entity Jörð (Old Norse: 'Earth').\nThought 5: Frigg is associated with Fulla, Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth. So the goddess associated with the goddess frigg is Fulla, Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth. I need to search Fulla, Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth next and find what tales they consist of.\nAction 5: Search[Fulla]\nObservation 5: Fulla (Old Norse: [ˈfulːɑ], possibly 'bountiful') or Volla (Old High German, 'plenitude') is a goddess in Germanic mythology. In Norse mythology, Fulla is described as wearing a golden band and as tending to the ashen box and the footwear owned by the goddess Frigg, and, in addition, Frigg confides in Fulla her secrets. Fulla is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in skaldic poetry. Volla (Folla) is attested in the \"Horse Cure\" Merseburg Incantation, recorded anonymously in the 10th century in Old High German, in which she assists in healing the wounded foal of Phol and is referred to as Frigg's sister. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess..\nThought 6: Fulla is described as wearing a golden band and as tending to the ashen box and the footwear owned by the goddess Frigg, and, in addition, Frigg confides in Fulla her secrets. So Fulla consists of the tales of wearing a golden band, tending to the ashen box and the footwear owned by the goddess Frigg, and Frigg confiding in Fulla her secrets. I need to search Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth next and find what tales they consist of.\nAction 6: Search[Lofn]\nObservation 6: In Norse mythology, Lofn (Old Norse: [ˈlovn], possibly \"comforter,\"[1] \"the comforter, the mild,\"[2] or \"loving\"[3]) is a goddess. Lofn is attested in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson and in kennings found in skaldic poetry. In the Prose Edda, Lofn is described as gentle in manner and as an arranger of marriages, even when they have been forbidden. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess.. In chapter 35 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, High provides brief descriptions of 16 ásynjur.\nThought 7: Lofn is gentle in manner and as an arranger of marriages, even when they have been forbidden. So Lofn consists of the tales of being gentle in manner and as an arranger of marriages, even when they have been forbidden. I need to search Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth next and find what tales they consist of.\nAction 7: Search[Hlín]\nObservation 7: In Norse mythology, Hlín is a goddess associated with the goddess Frigg. Hlín appears in a poem in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and in kennings found in skaldic poetry. Scholars have debated whether the stanza referring to her in the Prose Edda refers to Frigg. Hlín serves as a given name in Iceland, and Hlín receives veneration in the modern era in Germanic paganism's modern extension, Heathenry.. Scholars frequently explain the meaning behind the goddess's name as 'protector'.[1] The Prose Edda section Gylfaginning derives the name from a verb found in a proverb in an obscure and otherwise unattested Old Norse proverb: Þiaðan af er þat orðtak at sá er forðask hleinir.\nThought 8: Hlín is a goddess associated with the goddess Frigg. So Hlín consists of the tales of being a goddess associated with the goddess Frigg. I need to search Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth next and find what tales they consist of.\nAction 8: Search[Gná]\nObservation 8: In Norse mythology, Gná (Old Norse) is a goddess who runs errands in other worlds for the goddess Frigg and rides the flying, sea-treading horse Hófvarpnir (Old Norse \"he who throws his hoofs about\",[1] \"hoof-thrower\"[2] or \"hoof kicker\"[3]). Gná and Hófvarpnir are attested in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Scholarly have proposed that Gná is a \"goddess of fullness\" and, in the 1800s, as potentially cognate to Fama from Roman mythology. Hófvarpnir and the eight-legged steed Sleipnir have been cited examples of transcendent horses in Norse mythology.. In chapter 35 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, the enthroned figure of High provides brief descriptions of 16 ásynjur.\nThought 9: Gná runs errands in other worlds for the goddess Frigg and rides the flying, sea-treading horse Hófvarpnir. So Gná consists of the tales of running errands in other worlds for the goddess Frigg and riding the flying, sea-treading horse Hófvarpnir. I need to search ambiguously with the Earth next and find what tales it consists of.\nAction 9: Search[ambiguously with the Earth]\nObservation 9: Could not find ambiguously with the Earth. Similar: ['Frigg (category Articles with short description)', 'Earth', 'The Ambiguously Gay Duo', \"Tolkien's ambiguity\", 'Flat Earth'].\nThought 10: Returned tool-use answer is invalid, I need to use the backoff answer.\nAction 10: Use Backoff Answer.\nAnswer: The tales of the goddess Frigg",
