He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta. He is the long-time clown host of Bart and Lisa Simpson's favorite TV show, a variety show consisting of various kid-friendly sketches and often highly violent cartoons, most notably The Itchy & Scratchy Show. Despite his cheery onscreen persona, Krusty is actually a cynical, burnt-out, addiction-riddled smoker who is made miserable by show business but continues on anyway. He has become one of the most frequently occurring characters outside the main Simpson family and has been the focus of many episodes, some of which also feature Sideshow Bob..\nThought 3: Based on the above, I will provide an answer.\nAction 3: Finish[",

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be three types: \n(1) Search[entity], which searches the exact entity on Wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists. If not, it will return some similar entities to search.\n(2) Lookup[keyword], which returns the next sentence containing keyword in the current passage.\n(3) Finish[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.\nHere are some examples.\n\n\nQuestion: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?\nThought 1: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.\nAction 1: Search[Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.\nThought 2: It does not mention the eastern sector.

The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and Bob Kushell, and directed by Jim Reardon.\nThought 2: Bart the Fink involves Krusty the Clown. I need to search Krusty the Clown next.\nAction 2: Search[Krusty the Clown]\nObservation 2: Herschel Shmoikel Pinchas Yerucham Krustofsky (Yiddish: ‏הערשעל שמױקל פּינחס ירוחם קרוסטאָפֿסקי; Hebrew: הירשל שמויקל פנחס ירוחם קרוסטופסקי),[2][3] better known by his stage name Krusty the Clown (sometimes spelled as Krusty the Klown), is a recurring character on the animated television series The Simpsons. He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta. He is the long-time clown host of Bart and Lisa Simpson's favorite TV show, a variety show consisting of various kid-friendly sketches and often highly violent cartoons, most notably The Itchy & Scratchy Show. Despite his cheery onscreen persona, Krusty is actually a cynical, burnt-out, addiction-riddled smoker who is made miserable by show business but continues on anyway. He has become one of the most frequently occurring characters outside the main Simpson family and has been the focus of many episodes, some of which also feature Sideshow Bob..\nThought 3: Krusty the Clown is the host of The Krusty the Clown Show. So the kiddie show is The Krusty the Clown Show.\nAction 3: Finish[The Krusty the Clown Show]\nObservation 3: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\nThought 4: Based on the above, I will provide an answer.\nAction 4: Finish[",

The Bart the Fink episode of The Simpsons aired in February of 1996, and involves the host of the kiddie show Krusty the Clown.\nAnswer: Krusty the Clown\nAction 1: MeasureUncertainty [Krusty the Clown]\nObservation 1: Answer’s uncertainty is 1.95, which falls outside the acceptable threshold of 1.79.\nThought 2: Based on the uncertainty, I need to use an external tool to solve the question.\nAction 2: Activate Tool.\nThought 3: I need to search Bart the Fink, find the host of the kiddie show, then find the name of the kiddie show.\nAction 3: Search[Bart the Fink]\nObservation 3: \"Bart the Fink\" is the fifteenth episode of the seventh season of the American animated television series The Simpsons. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on February 11, 1996. In this episode, Bart inadvertently exposes Krusty the Clown as one of the biggest tax cheats in American history. With his career ruined, Krusty fakes his own death and adopts an alias, until Bart and Lisa convince him to become a television clown again.. The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and Bob Kushell, and directed by Jim Reardon.\nThought 4: Bart the Fink involves Krusty the Clown. I need to search Krusty the Clown next.\nAction 4: Search[Krusty the Clown]\nObservation 4: Herschel Shmoikel Pinchas Yerucham Krustofsky (Yiddish: ‏הערשעל שמױקל פּינחס ירוחם קרוסטאָפֿסקי; Hebrew: הירשל שמויקל פנחס ירוחם קרוסטופסקי),[2][3] better known by his stage name Krusty the Clown (sometimes spelled as Krusty the Klown), is a recurring character on the animated television series The Simpsons. He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta. He is the long-time clown host of Bart and Lisa Simpson's favorite TV show, a variety show consisting of various kid-friendly sketches and often highly violent cartoons, most notably The Itchy & Scratchy Show. Despite his cheery onscreen persona, Krusty is actually a cynical, burnt-out, addiction-riddled smoker who is made miserable by show business but continues on anyway. He has become one of the most frequently occurring characters outside the main Simpson family and has been the focus of many episodes, some of which also feature Sideshow Bob..\nThought 5: Krusty the Clown is the host of The Krusty the Clown Show. So the kiddie show is The Krusty the Clown Show.\nAction 5: Finish[The Krusty the Clown Show]\nObservation 5: Episode finished, reward = 0\nThought 6: Let me check the uncertainty of the returned answer.\nAction 6: MeasureUncertainty [The Krusty the Clown Show]\nObservation 7: Answer’s uncertainty is 2.2, which falls outside the acceptable threshold of 1.79.\nThought 7: For simplicity, answer is still kept.\nAction 7: Keep Answer.\nAnswer: The Krusty the Clown Show",
