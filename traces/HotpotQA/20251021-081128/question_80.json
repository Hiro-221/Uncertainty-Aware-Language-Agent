Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be three types: \n(1) Search[entity], which searches the exact entity on Wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists. If not, it will return some similar entities to search.\n(2) Lookup[keyword], which returns the next sentence containing keyword in the current passage.\n(3) Finish[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.\nHere are some examples.\n\n\nQuestion: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?\nThought 1: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.\nAction 1: Search[Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.\nThought 2: It does not mention the eastern sector.

Since 2005, she has primarily worked in voice acting, most notably voicing Francine Smith on the animated comedy television series American Dad!. Schaal was born in Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of Lois Schaal (née Treacy) and actor Richard Schaal.[1] Schaal's father was married to actress Valerie Harper from 1964 to 1978, during which time Harper was her stepmother.[2] From birth until she was five, Schaal lived with her parents in Crete, Illinois.\nThought 2: Wendy Schaal is an actress.

Short forms are Fran and Frannie.. Main pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact us.\nThought 3: Francine is a female given name.

Francine is voiced by Wendy Schaal.. Early in the series, Francine is often seen as the voice of reason in her dysfunctional family, adopting the stereotypical role of the long-suffering wife or doting mother. However, as the show progresses, her backstory develops with allusions to unconventional and surreal activities, including working for strip clubs, underground fighting rings, cult memberships, multiple murders, and substance abuse.. In the series, Francine was born to a wealthy couple from South Carolina, Francine's birth parents – Nicholas and Cassandra Dawson – gave her up when she was a baby so they could be upgraded to first class on a flight in \"Big Trouble in Little Langley\".\nThought 4: Francine Smith is a fictional character on the American animated sitcom American Dad!. So the show they are in is American Dad!. I need to search American Dad! next and find who created the show.\nAction 4: Search[American Dad!]\nObservation 4: American Dad! is an American animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane, Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series premiered on February 6, 2005, following Super Bowl XXXIX, with the rest of the first season airing from May 1 of the same year. The show centers around the Smiths, a dysfunctional family consisting of parents Stan and Francine, their children, Hayley and Steve, as well as a goldfish named Klaus and an extraterrestrial named Roger. In the seventh season, Hayley's boyfriend (turned husband) Jeff Fischer joined the main cast, followed by Rogu, Roger's neoplastic son who joined in season fifteen. Unlike MacFarlane's other show, Family Guy, American Dad! does not lean as heavily on the use of cutaway gags, instead deriving its humor mostly from the quirky characters and their relationships..\nThought 5: Based on the above, I will provide an answer.\nAction 5: Finish[",

Early in the series, Francine is often seen as the voice of reason in her dysfunctional family, adopting the stereotypical role of the long-suffering wife or doting mother.

The series premiered on February 6, 2005, following Super Bowl XXXIX, with the rest of the first season airing from May 1 of the same year. The show centers around the Smiths, a dysfunctional family consisting of parents Stan and Francine, their children, Hayley and Steve, as well as a goldfish named Klaus and an extraterrestrial named Roger. In the seventh season, Hayley's boyfriend (turned husband) Jeff Fischer joined the main cast, followed by Rogu, Roger's neoplastic son who joined in season fifteen. Unlike MacFarlane's other show, Family Guy, American Dad! does not lean as heavily on the use of cutaway gags, instead deriving its humor mostly from the quirky characters and their relationships..\nThought 5:",
