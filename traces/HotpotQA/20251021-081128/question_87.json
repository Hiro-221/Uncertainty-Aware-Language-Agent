Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be three types: \n(1) Search[entity], which searches the exact entity on Wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists. If not, it will return some similar entities to search.\n(2) Lookup[keyword], which returns the next sentence containing keyword in the current passage.\n(3) Finish[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.\nHere are some examples.\n\n\nQuestion: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?\nThought 1: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.\nAction 1: Search[Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.\nThought 2: It does not mention the eastern sector. So I need to look up eastern sector.\nAction 2: Lookup[eastern sector]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.\nThought 3: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.\nAction 3: Search[High Plains]\nObservation 3: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions:\nThought 4: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).\nAction 4: Search[High Plains (United States)]\nObservation 4: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]\nThought 5: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.\nAction 5: Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who.

Another song recorded by Dylan about the event is When the Levee Breaks who is the Husband and Wife team that wrote and recorded this song in 1929 ?\nThought 1: I need to search High Water, find the 1927 Lousiana Flood, then find the Husband and Wife team that wrote and recorded When the Levee Breaks in 1929.\nAction 1: Search[High Water]\nObservation 1: Could not find [High Water]. Similar: ['Hell or High Water (film)', 'High Water', 'High water mark', 'High Water (TV series)', 'Chart datum (redirect from Mean high water springs)'].\nThought 2: To find the 1927 Lousiana Flood, I can search High Water (TV series).\nAction 2: Search[High Water (TV series)]\nObservation 2: High Water (Polish: Wielka woda) is a Polish historical drama TV series created by Jan Holoubek and based on Kasper Bajon's work. It was released on Netflix on 5 October 2022.[2] The series is about the 1997 Central European flood specifically about the incidents in Wrocław (1997 Central European flood in Wrocław).. The series takes place in 1997 in Wrocław, when the 1997 Central European flood is nearing the city. The main character is the hydrologist Jaśmina Tremer, who returns to Wrocław after many years to help handle the crisis. During the series, the characters have to face not only the incompetence of the local authorities, but also their own past.[3].\nThought 3: High Water (TV series) is about the 1997 Central European flood, not the 1927 Lousiana Flood. So the 1927 Lousiana Flood must instead be High water mark.\nAction 3: Search[High water mark]\nObservation 3: A high water mark is a point that represents the maximum rise of a body of water over land. Such a mark is often the result of a flood, but high water marks may reflect an all-time high, an annual high (highest level to which water rose that year) or the high point for some other division of time. Knowledge of the high water mark for an area is useful in managing the development of that area, particularly in making preparations for flood surges.[1] High water marks from floods have been measured for planning purposes since at least as far back as the civilizations of ancient Egypt.[2] It is a common practice to create a physical marker indicating one or more of the highest water marks for an area, usually with a line at the level to which the water rose, and a notation of the date on which this high water mark was set. This may be a free-standing flood level sign or other marker, or it may be affixed to a building or other structure that was standing at the time of the flood that set the mark.[3]. A high water mark is not necessarily an actual physical mark,[4] but it is possible for water rising to a high point to leave a lasting physical impression such as floodwater staining.\nThought 4: Based on the above, I will provide an answer.\nAction 4: Finish[",

Such a mark is often the result of a flood, but high water marks may reflect an all-time high, an annual high (highest level to which water rose that year) or the high point for some other division of time. Knowledge of the high water mark for an area is useful in managing the development of that area, particularly in making preparations for flood surges.[1] High water marks from floods have been measured for planning purposes since at least as far back as the civilizations of ancient Egypt.[2] It is a common practice to create a physical marker indicating one or more of the highest water marks for an area, usually with a line at the level to which the water rose, and a notation of the date on which this high water mark was set. This may be a free-standing flood level sign or other marker, or it may be affixed to a building or other structure that was standing at the time of the flood that set the mark.[3]. A high water mark is not necessarily an actual physical mark,[4] but it is possible for water rising to a high point to leave a lasting physical impression such as floodwater staining.\nThought 4:",

Another song recorded by Dylan about the event is When the Levee Breaks who is the Husband and Wife team that wrote and recorded this song in 1929 ?\nThought 1: I need to search High Water, find the 1927 Lousiana Flood, then find the Husband and Wife team that wrote and recorded When the Levee Breaks in 1929.\nAction 1: Search[High Water]\nObservation 1: Could not find [High Water]. Similar: ['Hell or High Water (film)', 'High Water', 'High water mark', 'High Water (TV series)', 'Chart datum (redirect from Mean high water springs)'].\nThought 2: To find the 1927 Lousiana Flood, I can search High Water (TV series).\nAction 2: Search[High Water (TV series)]\nObservation 2: High Water (Polish: Wielka woda) is a Polish historical drama TV series created by Jan Holoubek and based on Kasper Bajon's work. It was released on Netflix on 5 October 2022.[2] The series is about the 1997 Central European flood specifically about the incidents in Wrocław (1997 Central European flood in Wrocław).. The series takes place in 1997 in Wrocław, when the 1997 Central European flood is nearing the city. The main character is the hydrologist Jaśmina Tremer, who returns to Wrocław after many years to help handle the crisis. During the series, the characters have to face not only the incompetence of the local authorities, but also their own past.[3].\nThought 3: High Water (TV series) is about the 1997 Central European flood, not the 1927 Lousiana Flood. So the 1927 Lousiana Flood must instead be High water mark.\nAction 3: Search[High water mark]\nObservation 3: A high water mark is a point that represents the maximum rise of a body of water over land. Such a mark is often the result of a flood, but high water marks may reflect an all-time high, an annual high (highest level to which water rose that year) or the high point for some other division of time. Knowledge of the high water mark for an area is useful in managing the development of that area, particularly in making preparations for flood surges.[1] High water marks from floods have been measured for planning purposes since at least as far back as the civilizations of ancient Egypt.[2] It is a common practice to create a physical marker indicating one or more of the highest water marks for an area, usually with a line at the level to which the water rose, and a notation of the date on which this high water mark was set. This may be a free-standing flood level sign or other marker, or it may be affixed to a building or other structure that was standing at the time of the flood that set the mark.[3]. A high water mark is not necessarily an actual physical mark,[4] but it is possible for water rising to a high point to leave a lasting physical impression such as floodwater staining.\nThought 4: High water mark is not a song, so the song about the 1927 Lousiana Flood must instead be When the Levee Breaks.\nAction 4: Search[When the Levee Breaks]\nObservation 4: \"When the Levee Breaks\" is a country blues song written and first recorded by  Kansas Joe McCoy and Memphis Minnie in 1929. The lyrics reflect experiences during the upheaval caused by the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927.. \"When the Levee Breaks\" was re-worked by English rock group Led Zeppelin and became the final song on their untitled fourth album. Singer Robert Plant used many of the original lyrics. The songwriting is credited to Memphis Minnie and the individual members of Led Zeppelin.[1]  Many other artists have performed and recorded versions of the song..\nThought 5: Based on the above, I will provide an answer.\nAction 5: Finish[",

It was released on Netflix on 5 October 2022.[2] The series is about the 1997 Central European flood specifically about the incidents in Wrocław (1997 Central European flood in Wrocław).. The series takes place in 1997 in Wrocław, when the 1997 Central European flood is nearing the city. The main character is the hydrologist Jaśmina Tremer, who returns to Wrocław after many years to help handle the crisis. During the series, the characters have to face not only the incompetence of the local authorities, but also their own past.[3].\nThought 3: High Water (TV series) is about the 1997 Central European flood, not the 1927 Lousiana Flood. So the 1927 Lousiana Flood must instead be High water mark.\nAction 3: Search[High water mark]\nObservation 3: A high water mark is a point that represents the maximum rise of a body of water over land. Such a mark is often the result of a flood, but high water marks may reflect an all-time high, an annual high (highest level to which water rose that year) or the high point for some other division of time. Knowledge of the high water mark for an area is useful in managing the development of that area, particularly in making preparations for flood surges.[1] High water marks from floods have been measured for planning purposes since at least as far back as the civilizations of ancient Egypt.[2] It is a common practice to create a physical marker indicating one or more of the highest water marks for an area, usually with a line at the level to which the water rose, and a notation of the date on which this high water mark was set. This may be a free-standing flood level sign or other marker, or it may be affixed to a building or other structure that was standing at the time of the flood that set the mark.[3]. A high water mark is not necessarily an actual physical mark,[4] but it is possible for water rising to a high point to leave a lasting physical impression such as floodwater staining.\nThought 4: High water mark is not a song, so the song about the 1927 Lousiana Flood must instead be When the Levee Breaks.\nAction 4: Search[When the Levee Breaks]\nObservation 4: \"When the Levee Breaks\" is a country blues song written and first recorded by  Kansas Joe McCoy and Memphis Minnie in 1929. The lyrics reflect experiences during the upheaval caused by the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927.. \"When the Levee Breaks\" was re-worked by English rock group Led Zeppelin and became the final song on their untitled fourth album. Singer Robert Plant used many of the original lyrics. The songwriting is credited to Memphis Minnie and the individual members of Led Zeppelin.[1]  Many other artists have performed and recorded versions of the song..\nThought 5:",

Similar: ['Hell or High Water (film)', 'High Water', 'High water mark', 'High Water (TV series)', 'Chart datum (redirect from Mean high water springs)'].\nThought 2: To find the 1927 Lousiana Flood, I can search High Water (TV series).\nAction 2: Search[High Water (TV series)]\nObservation 2: High Water (Polish: Wielka woda) is a Polish historical drama TV series created by Jan Holoubek and based on Kasper Bajon's work. It was released on Netflix on 5 October 2022.[2] The series is about the 1997 Central European flood specifically about the incidents in Wrocław (1997 Central European flood in Wrocław).. The series takes place in 1997 in Wrocław, when the 1997 Central European flood is nearing the city. The main character is the hydrologist Jaśmina Tremer, who returns to Wrocław after many years to help handle the crisis. During the series, the characters have to face not only the incompetence of the local authorities, but also their own past.[3].\nThought 3: High Water (TV series) is about the 1997 Central European flood, not the 1927 Lousiana Flood. So the 1927 Lousiana Flood must instead be High water mark.\nAction 3: Search[High water mark]\nObservation 3: A high water mark is a point that represents the maximum rise of a body of water over land. Such a mark is often the result of a flood, but high water marks may reflect an all-time high, an annual high (highest level to which water rose that year) or the high point for some other division of time. Knowledge of the high water mark for an area is useful in managing the development of that area, particularly in making preparations for flood surges.[1] High water marks from floods have been measured for planning purposes since at least as far back as the civilizations of ancient Egypt.[2] It is a common practice to create a physical marker indicating one or more of the highest water marks for an area, usually with a line at the level to which the water rose, and a notation of the date on which this high water mark was set. This may be a free-standing flood level sign or other marker, or it may be affixed to a building or other structure that was standing at the time of the flood that set the mark.[3]. A high water mark is not necessarily an actual physical mark,[4] but it is possible for water rising to a high point to leave a lasting physical impression such as floodwater staining.\nThought 4: High water mark is not a song, so the song about the 1927 Lousiana Flood must instead be When the Levee Breaks.\nAction 4: Search[When the Levee Breaks]\nObservation 4: \"When the Levee Breaks\" is a country blues song written and first recorded by  Kansas Joe McCoy and Memphis Minnie in 1929. The lyrics reflect experiences during the upheaval caused by the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927.. \"When the Levee Breaks\" was re-worked by English rock group Led Zeppelin and became the final song on their untitled fourth album. Singer Robert Plant used many of the original lyrics. The songwriting is credited to Memphis Minnie and the individual members of Led Zeppelin.[1]  Many other artists have performed and recorded versions of the song..\nThought 5: When the Levee Breaks was written and first recorded by Kansas Joe McCoy and Memphis Minnie in 1929. So the Husband and Wife team that wrote and recorded When the Levee Breaks in 1929 is Kansas Joe McCoy and Memphis Minnie.\nAction 5: Finish[Kansas Joe McCoy and Memphis Minnie]\nObservation 5: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\nThought 6: Based on the above, I will provide an answer.\nAction 6: Finish[",

It was released on Netflix on 5 October 2022.[2] The series is about the 1997 Central European flood specifically about the incidents in Wrocław (1997 Central European flood in Wrocław).. The series takes place in 1997 in Wrocław, when the 1997 Central European flood is nearing the city. The main character is the hydrologist Jaśmina Tremer, who returns to Wrocław after many years to help handle the crisis. During the series, the characters have to face not only the incompetence of the local authorities, but also their own past.[3].\nThought 5: High Water (TV series) is about the 1997 Central European flood, not the 1927 Lousiana Flood. So the 1927 Lousiana Flood must instead be High water mark.\nAction 5: Search[High water mark]\nObservation 5: A high water mark is a point that represents the maximum rise of a body of water over land. Such a mark is often the result of a flood, but high water marks may reflect an all-time high, an annual high (highest level to which water rose that year) or the high point for some other division of time. Knowledge of the high water mark for an area is useful in managing the development of that area, particularly in making preparations for flood surges.[1] High water marks from floods have been measured for planning purposes since at least as far back as the civilizations of ancient Egypt.[2] It is a common practice to create a physical marker indicating one or more of the highest water marks for an area, usually with a line at the level to which the water rose, and a notation of the date on which this high water mark was set. This may be a free-standing flood level sign or other marker, or it may be affixed to a building or other structure that was standing at the time of the flood that set the mark.[3]. A high water mark is not necessarily an actual physical mark,[4] but it is possible for water rising to a high point to leave a lasting physical impression such as floodwater staining.\nThought 6: High water mark is not a song, so the song about the 1927 Lousiana Flood must instead be When the Levee Breaks.\nAction 6: Search[When the Levee Breaks]\nObservation 6: \"When the Levee Breaks\" is a country blues song written and first recorded by  Kansas Joe McCoy and Memphis Minnie in 1929.
