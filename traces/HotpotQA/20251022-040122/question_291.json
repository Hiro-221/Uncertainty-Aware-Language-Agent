Similar: ['Interstate 81 in Virginia', 'Interstate 95', 'Interstate Highway System', 'United States Numbered Highway System', 'Interstate 70'].\nThought 4: To find the intersection, I can search Interstate 81 in Virginia.\nAction 4: Search[Interstate 81 in Virginia]\nObservation 4: Interstate 81 (I-81) is an 855.02-mile-long (1,376.02 km) Interstate Highway. In the US state of Virginia, I-81 runs for 324.92 miles (522.91 km), making the portion in Virginia longer than any other state's portion of the route. It is also the longest Interstate Highway within the borders of Virginia. It stretches from the Tennessee state line near Bristol to the West Virginia state line near Winchester. It enters Virginia from Bristol, Tennessee, and leaves Virginia into Berkeley County, West Virginia.\nThought 5:",

The town at the intersection of Interstate Highways 77 and  the longest Interstate highway within the borders of Virginia is Wytheville. The population of Wytheville is 8,211.\nAnswer: 8,211\nAction 1: MeasureUncertainty [8,211]\nObservation 1: Answer’s uncertainty is 1.79, which falls outside the acceptable threshold of 1.79.\nThought 2: Based on the uncertainty, I need to use an external tool to solve the question.\nAction 2: Activate Tool.\nThought 3: I need to search Interstate Highways 77 and the longest Interstate highway within the borders of Virginia, find the intersection, then find the population of the town at the intersection.\nAction 3: Search[Interstate Highways 77]\nObservation 3: Could not find Interstate Highways 77. Similar: ['Interstate 77', 'Interstate 77 in Ohio', 'Interstate 77 in South Carolina', 'Interstate 77 in Virginia', 'Interstate Highway System'].\nThought 4: To find the intersection, I can search Interstate 77.\nAction 4: Search[Interstate 77]\nObservation 4: Interstate 77 (I-77) is a north–south Interstate Highway in the Eastern United States. It traverses diverse terrain, from the mountainous state of West Virginia to the rolling farmlands of North Carolina and Ohio. It largely supplants the old U.S. Route 21 (US 21) between Cleveland, Ohio, and Columbia, South Carolina, as an important north–south corridor through the middle Appalachian Mountains. The southern terminus of I-77 is in Cayce, South Carolina, in Lexington County at the junction with I-26.[2] The northern terminus is in Cleveland at the junction with I-90.\nThought 5: Interstate 77 is in Ohio, so I need to search the longest Interstate highway within the borders of Virginia.\nAction 5: Search[the longest Interstate highway within the borders of Virginia]\nObservation 5: Could not find the longest Interstate highway within the borders of Virginia. Similar: ['Interstate 81 in Virginia', 'Interstate 95', 'Interstate Highway System', 'United States Numbered Highway System', 'Interstate 70'].\nThought 6: To find the intersection, I can search Interstate 81 in Virginia.\nAction 6: Search[Interstate 81 in Virginia]\nObservation 6: Interstate 81 (I-81) is an 855.02-mile-long (1,376.02 km) Interstate Highway. In the US state of Virginia, I-81 runs for 324.92 miles (522.91 km), making the portion in Virginia longer than any other state's portion of the route. It is also the longest Interstate Highway within the borders of Virginia. It stretches from the Tennessee state line near Bristol to the West Virginia state line near Winchester. It enters Virginia from Bristol, Tennessee, and leaves Virginia into Berkeley County, West Virginia.\nThought 7: Interstate 81 in Virginia is the longest Interstate highway within the borders of Virginia. So the intersection is Interstate 77 and Interstate 81 in Virginia. I need to search Interstate 77 and Interstate 81 in Virginia, find the intersection, then find the population of the town at the intersection.\nAction 7: Search[Interstate 77 and Interstate 81 in Virginia]\nObservation 7: Could not find Interstate 77 and Interstate 81 in Virginia.
