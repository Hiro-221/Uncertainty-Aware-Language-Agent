Her research interests concerned the characterization of meteoritic organic compounds in elucidating the evolution of planetary homochirality. Pizzarello was a project collaborator and co-investigator for the NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI), the president of the International Society for the Study of the Origin of Life (2014-2017), and an emerita professor at Arizona State University (ASU).. Sandra Pizzarello was born in Venice, Italy on 24 April 1933. In 1955, she graduated summa cum laude from the University of Padua earning her Doctor of Biological Sciences degree under her adviser Professor Roncato.\nThought 4: Sandra Pizzarello is a professor at Arizona State University. I need to search Doctorate next and find its organization.\nAction 4: Search[Doctorate]\nObservation 4: A doctorate (from Latin doctor, meaning \"teacher\") or doctoral degree is a postgraduate academic degree awarded by universities and some other educational institutions, derived from the ancient formalism licentia docendi (\"licence to teach\").. In most countries, a research degree qualifies the holder to teach at university level in the degree's field or work in a specific profession. There are a number of doctoral degrees; the most common is the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), awarded in many different fields, ranging from the humanities to scientific disciplines.. Many universities also award honorary doctorates to individuals deemed worthy of special recognition, either for scholarly work or other contributions to the university or society.. The term doctor derives from Latin, meaning \"teacher\" or \"instructor\".\nThought 5: Doctorate is a degree.
