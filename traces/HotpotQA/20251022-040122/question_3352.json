Cimicifuga is found in North America. South Africa is further south than North America, so the genus of flowering plant found in an environment further south is Crocosmia.\nAnswer: Crocosmia\nAction 1: MeasureUncertainty [Crocosmia]\nObservation 1: Answer's uncertainty is 1.39, which falls within the acceptable threshold of 1.79.\nThought 2: Based on the uncertainty, answer is kept.\nAction 2: Keep Answer.\nAnswer: Crocosmia",
