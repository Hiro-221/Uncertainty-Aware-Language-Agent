Dubbed the \"King of Cocaine\", Escobar was one of the wealthiest conventional criminals in history, having amassed an estimated net worth of US$30 billion by his death,. while his drug cartel monopolized the cocaine trade into the US in the 1980s and early 1990s.[1][2]. Born in Rionegro and raised in Medellín, Escobar studied briefly at Universidad Autónoma Latinoamericana of Medellín but left without graduating; he instead began engaging in criminality, selling illegal cigarettes and fake lottery tickets, as well as participating in motor vehicle theft.

Season 1, comprising 10 episodes, originally aired on August 28, 2015, as a Netflix exclusive.[3] The series was renewed for a second season, which premiered on September 2, 2016, with 10 episodes.[4] On September 6, 2016, Netflix renewed the series for its third and fourth seasons.[5] Season 3 premiered on September 1, 2017, but on July 18, 2018, the directors announced that season 4 would instead reset as season 1 of a new Netflix original series, titled Narcos: Mexico. The new series, released on November 16, 2018,[6] is set in Mexico in the 1980s.[7].\nThought 6: Narcos is an American crime drama television series. I need to search Pablo Escobar next and find what nomination Wagner Moura received for playing the lead role.\nAction 6: Search[Pablo Escobar]\nObservation 6: Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria (/ˈɛskəbɑːr/; Spanish: [ˈpaβlo eskoˈβaɾ]; 1 December 1949 – 2 December 1993) was a Colombian drug lord, narcoterrorist, and politician who was the founder and leader of the Medellín Cartel. Dubbed the \"King of Cocaine\", Escobar was one of the wealthiest conventional criminals in history, having amassed an estimated net worth of US$30 billion by his death,. while his drug cartel monopolized the cocaine trade into the US in the 1980s and early 1990s.[1][2]. Born in Rionegro and raised in Medellín, Escobar studied briefly at Universidad Autónoma Latinoamericana of Medellín but left without graduating; he instead began engaging in criminality, selling illegal cigarettes and fake lottery tickets, as well as participating in motor vehicle theft. In the early 1970s, he began to work for various drug smugglers, often kidnapping and holding people for ransom.\nThought 7: Based on the above, I will provide an answer.\nAction 7: Finish[",

      "full_prompt": "Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Action, Observation steps. Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be three types: \n(1) Search[entity], which searches the exact entity on Wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists. If not, it will return some similar entities to search.\n(2) Lookup[keyword], which returns the next sentence containing keyword in the current passage.\n(3) Finish[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.\nHere are some examples.\n\n\nQuestion: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?\nThought 1: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.\nAction 1: Search[Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.\nThought 2: It does not mention the eastern sector. So I need to look up eastern sector.\nAction 2: Lookup[eastern sector]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.\nThought 3: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.\nAction 3: Search[High Plains]\nObservation 3: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions:\nThought 4: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).\nAction 4: Search[High Plains (United States)]\nObservation 4: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]\nThought 5: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.\nAction 5: Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.\nAction 1: Search[Milhouse]\nObservation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up \"named after\".\nAction 2: Lookup[named after]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. \nThought 3: Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.\nAction 3: Finish[Richard Nixon]\nQuestion: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?\nThought 1: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.\nAction 1: Search[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 1: Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell]. Similar: ['Adam Clayton Powell III', 'Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)', 'Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building', 'Isabel Washington Powell', 'Adam Powell', 'Adam Clayton Powell (film)', 'Giancarlo Esposito'].\nThought 2: To find the documentary, I can search Adam Clayton Powell (film).\nAction 2: Search[Adam Clayton Powell (film)]\nObservation 2: Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Richard Kilberg.\nThe film is about the rise and fall of influential African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired as part of the PBS series The American Experience.\nThought 3: Adam Clayton Powell (film) is a documentary about an African-American politician, not Finnish rock groups. So the documentary about Finnish rock groups must instead be The Saimaa Gesture.\nAction 3: Finish[The Saimaa Gesture]\nQuestion: What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?\nThought 1: I need to search Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, find their professions, then find the profession they have in common.\nAction 1: Search[Nicholas Ray]\nObservation 1: Nicholas Ray (born Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr., August 7, 1911 – June 16, 1979) was an American film director, screenwriter, and actor best known for the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause.\nThought 2: Professions of Nicholas Ray are director, screenwriter, and actor.
