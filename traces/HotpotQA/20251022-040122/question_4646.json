It centered on the Egyptians' interactions with many deities believed to be present and in control of the world. About 1,500 deities are known.[1] Rituals such as prayer and offerings were provided to the gods to gain their favor. Formal religious practice centered on the pharaohs, the rulers of Egypt, believed to possess divine powers by virtue of their positions. They acted as intermediaries between their people and the gods, and were obligated to sustain the gods through rituals and offerings so that they could maintain Ma'at, the order of the cosmos, and repel Isfet, which was chaos.\nThought 2: Based on the above, I will provide an answer.\nAction 2: Finish[",

It centered on the Egyptians' interactions with many deities believed to be present and in control of the world. About 1,500 deities are known.[1] Rituals such as prayer and offerings were provided to the gods to gain their favor. Formal religious practice centered on the pharaohs, the rulers of Egypt, believed to possess divine powers by virtue of their positions. They acted as intermediaries between their people and the gods, and were obligated to sustain the gods through rituals and offerings so that they could maintain Ma'at, the order of the cosmos, and repel Isfet, which was chaos.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell how a citizen would be weighted to decide if they where worthy of damnation and would face the torment in the lake of fire. So I need to look up \"weighted\".\nAction 2: Lookup[weighted]\nObservation 2: No more results.\n\nThought 3: Based on the above, I will provide an answer.\nAction 3: Finish[",

It centered on the Egyptians' interactions with many deities believed to be present and in control of the world. About 1,500 deities are known.[1] Rituals such as prayer and offerings were provided to the gods to gain their favor. Formal religious practice centered on the pharaohs, the rulers of Egypt, believed to possess divine powers by virtue of their positions. They acted as intermediaries between their people and the gods, and were obligated to sustain the gods through rituals and offerings so that they could maintain Ma'at, the order of the cosmos, and repel Isfet, which was chaos.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell how a citizen would be weighted to decide if they where worthy of damnation and would face the torment in the lake of fire. So I need to look up \"weighted\".\nAction 2: Lookup[weighted]\nObservation 2: No more results.\n\nThought 3: The paragraph does not tell how a citizen would be weighted to decide if they where worthy of damnation and would face the torment in the lake of fire. So I need to look up \"worthy\".\nAction 3: Lookup[worthy]\nObservation 3: (Result 1 / 1) If the deceased was judged worthy, his or her ka and ba were united into an akh.[35] Several beliefs coexisted about the akh's destination.\nThought 4: Based on the above, I will provide an answer.\nAction 4: Finish[",

It centered on the Egyptians' interactions with many deities believed to be present and in control of the world. About 1,500 deities are known.[1] Rituals such as prayer and offerings were provided to the gods to gain their favor. Formal religious practice centered on the pharaohs, the rulers of Egypt, believed to possess divine powers by virtue of their positions. They acted as intermediaries between their people and the gods, and were obligated to sustain the gods through rituals and offerings so that they could maintain Ma'at, the order of the cosmos, and repel Isfet, which was chaos.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell how a citizen would be weighted to decide if they where worthy of damnation and would face the torment in the lake of fire. So I need to look up \"weighted\".\nAction 2: Lookup[weighted]\nObservation 2: No more results.\n\nThought 3: The paragraph does not tell how a citizen would be weighted to decide if they where worthy of damnation and would face the torment in the lake of fire.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be three types: \n(1) Search[entity], which searches the exact entity on Wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists. If not, it will return some similar entities to search.\n(2) Lookup[keyword], which returns the next sentence containing keyword in the current passage.\n(3) Finish[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.\nHere are some examples.\n\n\nQuestion: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?\nThought 1: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.\nAction 1: Search[Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.\nThought 2: It does not mention the eastern sector. So I need to look up eastern sector.\nAction 2: Lookup[eastern sector]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.\nThought 3: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains.

It centered on the Egyptians' interactions with many deities believed to be present and in control of the world. About 1,500 deities are known.[1] Rituals such as prayer and offerings were provided to the gods to gain their favor. Formal religious practice centered on the pharaohs, the rulers of Egypt, believed to possess divine powers by virtue of their positions. They acted as intermediaries between their people and the gods, and were obligated to sustain the gods through rituals and offerings so that they could maintain Ma'at, the order of the cosmos, and repel Isfet, which was chaos.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell how a citizen would be weighted to decide if they where worthy of damnation and would face the torment in the lake of fire.

It centered on the Egyptians' interactions with many deities believed to be present and in control of the world. About 1,500 deities are known.[1] Rituals such as prayer and offerings were provided to the gods to gain their favor. Formal religious practice centered on the pharaohs, the rulers of Egypt, believed to possess divine powers by virtue of their positions. They acted as intermediaries between their people and the gods, and were obligated to sustain the gods through rituals and offerings so that they could maintain Ma'at, the order of the cosmos, and repel Isfet, which was chaos.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell how a citizen would be weighted to decide if they where worthy of damnation and would face the torment in the lake of fire. So I need to look up \"weighted\".\nAction 2: Lookup[weighted]\nObservation 2: No more results.\n\nThought 3: The paragraph does not tell how a citizen would be weighted to decide if they where worthy of damnation and would face the torment in the lake of fire. So I need to look up \"worthy\".\nAction 3: Lookup[worthy]\nObservation 3: (Result 1 / 1) If the deceased was judged worthy, his or her ka and ba were united into an akh.[35] Several beliefs coexisted about the akh's destination.\nThought 4: The paragraph does not tell how a citizen would be weighted to decide if they where worthy of damnation and would face the torment in the lake of fire. So I need to look up \"damnation\".\nAction 4: Lookup[damnation]\nObservation 4: No more results.\n\nThought 5: The paragraph does not tell how a citizen would be weighted to decide if they where worthy of damnation and would face the torment in the lake of fire. So I need to look up \"face\".\nAction 5: Lookup[face]\nObservation 5: No more results.\n\nThought 6: The paragraph does not tell how a citizen would be weighted to decide if they where worthy of damnation and would face the torment in the lake of fire. So I need to look up \"torment\".\nAction 6: Lookup[torment]\nObservation 6: No more results.\n\nThought 7: Based on the above, I will provide an answer.\nAction 7: Finish[",

So I need to look up eastern sector.\nAction 2: Lookup[eastern sector]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.\nThought 3: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.\nAction 3: Search[High Plains]\nObservation 3: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions:\nThought 4: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).\nAction 4: Search[High Plains (United States)]\nObservation 4: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]\nThought 5: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.\nAction 5: Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.\nAction 1: Search[Milhouse]\nObservation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up \"named after\".\nAction 2: Lookup[named after]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. \nThought 3: Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.\nAction 3: Finish[Richard Nixon]\nQuestion: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?\nThought 1: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.\nAction 1: Search[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 1: Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell]. Similar: ['Adam Clayton Powell III', 'Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)', 'Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building', 'Isabel Washington Powell', 'Adam Powell', 'Adam Clayton Powell (film)', 'Giancarlo Esposito'].\nThought 2: To find the documentary, I can search Adam Clayton Powell (film).\nAction 2: Search[Adam Clayton Powell (film)]\nObservation 2: Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Richard Kilberg.\nThe film is about the rise and fall of influential African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired as part of the PBS series The American Experience.\nThought 3: Adam Clayton Powell (film) is a documentary about an African-American politician, not Finnish rock groups.

It centered on the Egyptians' interactions with many deities believed to be present and in control of the world. About 1,500 deities are known.[1] Rituals such as prayer and offerings were provided to the gods to gain their favor. Formal religious practice centered on the pharaohs, the rulers of Egypt, believed to possess divine powers by virtue of their positions. They acted as intermediaries between their people and the gods, and were obligated to sustain the gods through rituals and offerings so that they could maintain Ma'at, the order of the cosmos, and repel Isfet, which was chaos.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell how a citizen would be weighted to decide if they where worthy of damnation and would face the torment in the lake of fire. So I need to look up \"weighted\".\nAction 2: Lookup[weighted]\nObservation 2: No more results.\n\nThought 3: The paragraph does not tell how a citizen would be weighted to decide if they where worthy of damnation and would face the torment in the lake of fire.
