Maria Merryweather inherits a book after her father's death: The Ancient Chronicles of Moonacre Valley.\nThought 2: The Secret of Moonacre was directed by Gábor Csupó. I need to search Gábor Csupó next and find the animation studio founded by him.\nAction 2: Search[Gábor Csupó]\nObservation 2: Gábor Csupó (/ˌɡɑːbɔːr ˈtʃuːpoʊ/ GAH-bor CHOO-poh, Hungarian: [ˈɡaːbor ˈtʃupoː]; born September 29, 1952) is a Hungarian-born American[2] animator, writer, director, producer and graphic designer. He is co-founder of the animation studio Klasky Csupo, which produced the first three years of The Simpsons, as well as episodes of Rugrats, The Wild Thornberrys, Duckman, Stressed Eric, Rocket Power, As Told by Ginger,  and Aaahh!!! Real Monsters.. Csupó was born on September 29, 1952, to Jewish parents in Budapest, Hungary.[3][4][5]. After four years at the Pannónia Filmstúdió animation studios, Csupó defected to the West in 1975,[3] traveling along with several others, including musician Leslie Mándoki, through a railway tunnel connecting Yugoslavia and Austria.[6] While working in Stockholm, Sweden he met Arlene Klasky, an American-born animator.[2] The two subsequently started their own company, Klasky Csupo, which produced many popular animated television shows.. Before starting Klasky Csupo he emigrated to the United States in the late 1970s and began working as an animator for Hanna-Barbera on a few shows such as Casper and the Angels, Scooby and Scrappy-Doo, and The World's Greatest SuperFriends..\nThought 3: Gábor Csupó founded Klasky Csupo. So the animation studio founded by Gábor Csupó is Klasky Csupo.\nAction 3: Finish[Klasky Csupo]\nObservation 3: Episode finished, reward = 1\n\nThought 4: Based on the above, I will provide an answer.\nAction 4: Finish[",
