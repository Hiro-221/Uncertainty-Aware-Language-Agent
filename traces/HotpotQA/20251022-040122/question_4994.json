Honeysuckle has 180 species. 20 (Quesnelia) < 180 (Honeysuckle), so Honeysuckle has more species.\nAnswer: Honeysuckle\nAction 1: MeasureUncertainty [Honeysuckle]\nObservation 1: Answer's uncertainty is 1.61, which falls within the acceptable threshold of 1.79.\nThought 2: Based on the uncertainty, answer is kept.\nAction 2: Keep Answer.\nAnswer: Honeysuckle",
