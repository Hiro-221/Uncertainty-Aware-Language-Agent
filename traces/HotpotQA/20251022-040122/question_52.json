I need to search Richard Hawley next and find its occupations.\nAction 2: Search[Richard Hawley]\nObservation 2: Richard Willis Hawley[5] (born 17 January 1967) is an English singer-songwriter, guitarist, and producer. After his first band Treebound Story (formed while he was still at school) broke up, Hawley found success as a member of Britpop band Longpigs in the 1990s.[6] He played with Pulp, led by his friend Jarvis Cocker, as a touring musician for a short time.[7] As a solo musician, Hawley has released ten studio albums. He has been nominated for a Mercury Prize twice and once for a Brit Award. He has collaborated with Lisa Marie Presley, Shakespears Sister, Arctic Monkeys, Manic Street Preachers, Elbow, Duane Eddy and Paul Weller.[6]. Born in Sheffield, Hawley grew up with two sisters in a working-class area of the city.[6][8] He was born with a cleft palate, which required numerous operations.[7] Both of his parents were musicians; his father Dave Hawley was a guitarist with a number of local bands (on his death, the Sheffield Star called him a \"Sheffield music legend\"),[9] and his mother Lynne a singer.[10] They divorced when he was 16 years old.[7] He is a lifelong supporter of local football club Sheffield Wednesday.[11] He noted that \"I always wrote songs since childhood\" and realising that \"you could actually make something up of your own was quite a big one then\".[6] He attended Hucklow Middle School together with future Pulp bassist  Steve Mackey, and passed his O-levels.\nThought 3: Occupations of Richard Hawley are singer, songwriter, guitarist, and producer. So Scott Weiland and Richard Hawley have the same occupations.\nAction 3: Finish[singer, songwriter, guitarist, producer]\nObservation 3: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\nThought 4: Based on the above, I will provide an answer.\nAction 4: Finish[",
