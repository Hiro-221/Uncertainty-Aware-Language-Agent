Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be three types: \n(1) Search[entity], which searches the exact entity on Wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists. If not, it will return some similar entities to search.\n(2) Lookup[keyword], which returns the next sentence containing keyword in the current passage.\n(3) Finish[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.\nHere are some examples.\n\n\nQuestion: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?\nThought 1: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.\nAction 1: Search[Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.\nThought 2: It does not mention the eastern sector.

The airport is home to the 642nd Aviation Support Battalion, part of the 42nd Infantry Division.[4]. A 1910 newspaper article cited \"a site near Scottsville Road\", along with the Baker Farm in Genesee Valley Park, as possible locations for \"airships\" to fly from Rochester to Toronto.[5][title missing] The Baker Farm was located south of the original Genesee Valley Park, and was donated to the Parks Department of the City of Rochester in 1908.[6][title missing] The golf course at Genesee Valley Park was extended to include the Baker Farm in 1914.[7][title missing] During World War I, the Baker Farm area of the park, renamed \"Baker Field\", was used for military purposes. The United States School of Aerial Photography had been created at Kodak Park in Rochester, and Baker Field was the airfield associated with the project.[8][title missing] Military use of the field ceased in 1918.[9][title missing] Baker Field continued to be used as an airfield for a year or two thereafter,[10][11][title missing] but flood conditions made it unsuitable for airfield use in the long run.[12][title missing] Britton Field, located just west of Baker Field, became the primary airport for the Rochester area.. The site of the Greater Rochester International Airport, originally known as Britton Field, was used for aviation purposes as early as 1919.\nThought 2: Based on the above, I will provide an answer.\nAction 2: Finish[",

The airport is home to the 642nd Aviation Support Battalion, part of the 42nd Infantry Division.[4]. A 1910 newspaper article cited \"a site near Scottsville Road\", along with the Baker Farm in Genesee Valley Park, as possible locations for \"airships\" to fly from Rochester to Toronto.[5][title missing] The Baker Farm was located south of the original Genesee Valley Park, and was donated to the Parks Department of the City of Rochester in 1908.[6][title missing] The golf course at Genesee Valley Park was extended to include the Baker Farm in 1914.[7][title missing] During World War I, the Baker Farm area of the park, renamed \"Baker Field\", was used for military purposes. The United States School of Aerial Photography had been created at Kodak Park in Rochester, and Baker Field was the airfield associated with the project.[8][title missing] Military use of the field ceased in 1918.[9][title missing] Baker Field continued to be used as an airfield for a year or two thereafter,[10][11][title missing] but flood conditions made it unsuitable for airfield use in the long run.[12][title missing] Britton Field, located just west of Baker Field, became the primary airport for the Rochester area.. The site of the Greater Rochester International Airport, originally known as Britton Field, was used for aviation purposes as early as 1919.\nThought 2:",

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be three types: \n(1) Search[entity], which searches the exact entity on Wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists. If not, it will return some similar entities to search.\n(2) Lookup[keyword], which returns the next sentence containing keyword in the current passage.\n(3) Finish[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.\nHere are some examples.\n\n\nQuestion: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?\nThought 1: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.\nAction 1: Search[Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.\nThought 2: It does not mention the eastern sector. So I need to look up eastern sector.\nAction 2: Lookup[eastern sector]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.\nThought 3: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.\nAction 3: Search[High Plains]\nObservation 3: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions:\nThought 4: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).\nAction 4: Search[High Plains (United States)]\nObservation 4: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]\nThought 5: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.\nAction 5: Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.\nAction 1: Search[Milhouse]\nObservation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up \"named after\".\nAction 2: Lookup[named after]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. \nThought 3: Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.\nAction 3: Finish[Richard Nixon]\nQuestion: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?\nThought 1: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.\nAction 1: Search[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 1: Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell].

The airport is home to the 642nd Aviation Support Battalion, part of the 42nd Infantry Division.[4]. A 1910 newspaper article cited \"a site near Scottsville Road\", along with the Baker Farm in Genesee Valley Park, as possible locations for \"airships\" to fly from Rochester to Toronto.[5][title missing] The Baker Farm was located south of the original Genesee Valley Park, and was donated to the Parks Department of the City of Rochester in 1908.[6][title missing] The golf course at Genesee Valley Park was extended to include the Baker Farm in 1914.[7][title missing] During World War I, the Baker Farm area of the park, renamed \"Baker Field\", was used for military purposes. The United States School of Aerial Photography had been created at Kodak Park in Rochester, and Baker Field was the airfield associated with the project.[8][title missing] Military use of the field ceased in 1918.[9][title missing] Baker Field continued to be used as an airfield for a year or two thereafter,[10][11][title missing] but flood conditions made it unsuitable for airfield use in the long run.[12][title missing] Britton Field, located just west of Baker Field, became the primary airport for the Rochester area.. The site of the Greater Rochester International Airport, originally known as Britton Field, was used for aviation purposes as early as 1919.\nThought 2: Greater Rochester International Airport is home to the 642nd Aviation Support Battalion. I need to search Valley International Airport next.\nAction 2: Search[Valley International Airport]\nObservation 2: Valley International Airport (VIA) (IATA: HRL, ICAO: KHRL, FAA LID: HRL) is owned by the city of Harlingen, in Cameron County, Texas, United States.[1] It is operated by a nine-member airport board appointed by the mayor. HRL is centrally located in the Rio Grande Valley (RGV) and is referred to as the \"Gateway to South Padre Island\" with travel amenities and door to door transportation to South Padre Island. With over 2,500 acres (1,000 ha) HRL is the largest airport in the RGV with room for future expansion. HRL has the longest runways in the area with modern aircraft approach systems that minimize chances of delays during bad weather.. As of 2024, the airport is served by Southwest Airlines, United Airlines (via United Express), American Airlines (via American Eagle), Delta Air Lines (seasonally), Delta Connection, and Sun Country Airlines (seasonal service).\nThought 3: Based on the above, I will provide an answer.\nAction 3: Finish[",

The United States School of Aerial Photography had been created at Kodak Park in Rochester, and Baker Field was the airfield associated with the project.[8][title missing] Military use of the field ceased in 1918.[9][title missing] Baker Field continued to be used as an airfield for a year or two thereafter,[10][11][title missing] but flood conditions made it unsuitable for airfield use in the long run.[12][title missing] Britton Field, located just west of Baker Field, became the primary airport for the Rochester area.. The site of the Greater Rochester International Airport, originally known as Britton Field, was used for aviation purposes as early as 1919.\nThought 2: Greater Rochester International Airport is home to the 642nd Aviation Support Battalion. I need to search Valley International Airport next.\nAction 2: Search[Valley International Airport]\nObservation 2: Valley International Airport (VIA) (IATA: HRL, ICAO: KHRL, FAA LID: HRL) is owned by the city of Harlingen, in Cameron County, Texas, United States.[1] It is operated by a nine-member airport board appointed by the mayor. HRL is centrally located in the Rio Grande Valley (RGV) and is referred to as the \"Gateway to South Padre Island\" with travel amenities and door to door transportation to South Padre Island. With over 2,500 acres (1,000 ha) HRL is the largest airport in the RGV with room for future expansion. HRL has the longest runways in the area with modern aircraft approach systems that minimize chances of delays during bad weather.. As of 2024, the airport is served by Southwest Airlines, United Airlines (via United Express), American Airlines (via American Eagle), Delta Air Lines (seasonally), Delta Connection, and Sun Country Airlines (seasonal service).\nThought 3:",

The airport is home to the 642nd Aviation Support Battalion, part of the 42nd Infantry Division.[4]. A 1910 newspaper article cited \"a site near Scottsville Road\", along with the Baker Farm in Genesee Valley Park, as possible locations for \"airships\" to fly from Rochester to Toronto.[5][title missing] The Baker Farm was located south of the original Genesee Valley Park, and was donated to the Parks Department of the City of Rochester in 1908.[6][title missing] The golf course at Genesee Valley Park was extended to include the Baker Farm in 1914.[7][title missing] During World War I, the Baker Farm area of the park, renamed \"Baker Field\", was used for military purposes. The United States School of Aerial Photography had been created at Kodak Park in Rochester, and Baker Field was the airfield associated with the project.[8][title missing] Military use of the field ceased in 1918.[9][title missing] Baker Field continued to be used as an airfield for a year or two thereafter,[10][11][title missing] but flood conditions made it unsuitable for airfield use in the long run.[12][title missing] Britton Field, located just west of Baker Field, became the primary airport for the Rochester area.. The site of the Greater Rochester International Airport, originally known as Britton Field, was used for aviation purposes as early as 1919.\nThought 2: Greater Rochester International Airport is home to the 642nd Aviation Support Battalion. I need to search Valley International Airport next.\nAction 2: Search[Valley International Airport]\nObservation 2: Valley International Airport (VIA) (IATA: HRL, ICAO: KHRL, FAA LID: HRL) is owned by the city of Harlingen, in Cameron County, Texas, United States.[1] It is operated by a nine-member airport board appointed by the mayor. HRL is centrally located in the Rio Grande Valley (RGV) and is referred to as the \"Gateway to South Padre Island\" with travel amenities and door to door transportation to South Padre Island. With over 2,500 acres (1,000 ha) HRL is the largest airport in the RGV with room for future expansion. HRL has the longest runways in the area with modern aircraft approach systems that minimize chances of delays during bad weather.. As of 2024, the airport is served by Southwest Airlines, United Airlines (via United Express), American Airlines (via American Eagle), Delta Air Lines (seasonally), Delta Connection, and Sun Country Airlines (seasonal service).\nThought 3: Valley International Airport is not home to the 642nd Aviation Support Battalion. So Greater Rochester International Airport is home to the 642nd Aviation Support Battalion.\nAction 3: Finish[Greater Rochester International Airport]\nObservation 3: Episode finished, reward = 1\n\nThought 4: Based on the above, I will provide an answer.\nAction 4: Finish[",

The airport is home to the 642nd Aviation Support Battalion, part of the 42nd Infantry Division.[4]. A 1910 newspaper article cited \"a site near Scottsville Road\", along with the Baker Farm in Genesee Valley Park, as possible locations for \"airships\" to fly from Rochester to Toronto.[5][title missing] The Baker Farm was located south of the original Genesee Valley Park, and was donated to the Parks Department of the City of Rochester in 1908.[6][title missing] The golf course at Genesee Valley Park was extended to include the Baker Farm in 1914.[7][title missing] During World War I, the Baker Farm area of the park, renamed \"Baker Field\", was used for military purposes. The United States School of Aerial Photography had been created at Kodak Park in Rochester, and Baker Field was the airfield associated with the project.[8][title missing] Military use of the field ceased in 1918.[9][title missing] Baker Field continued to be used as an airfield for a year or two thereafter,[10][11][title missing] but flood conditions made it unsuitable for airfield use in the long run.[12][title missing] Britton Field, located just west of Baker Field, became the primary airport for the Rochester area..

HRL is centrally located in the Rio Grande Valley (RGV) and is referred to as the \"Gateway to South Padre Island\" with travel amenities and door to door transportation to South Padre Island. With over 2,500 acres (1,000 ha) HRL is the largest airport in the RGV with room for future expansion. HRL has the longest runways in the area with modern aircraft approach systems that minimize chances of delays during bad weather..
