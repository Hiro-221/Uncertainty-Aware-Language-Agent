So I need to look up eastern sector.\nAction 2: Lookup[eastern sector]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.\nThought 3: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.\nAction 3: Search[High Plains]\nObservation 3: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions:\nThought 4: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).\nAction 4: Search[High Plains (United States)]\nObservation 4: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]\nThought 5: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.\nAction 5: Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.\nAction 1: Search[Milhouse]\nObservation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up \"named after\".\nAction 2: Lookup[named after]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. \nThought 3: Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.\nAction 3: Finish[Richard Nixon]\nQuestion: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?\nThought 1: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.\nAction 1: Search[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 1: Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell]. Similar: ['Adam Clayton Powell III', 'Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)', 'Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building', 'Isabel Washington Powell', 'Adam Powell', 'Adam Clayton Powell (film)', 'Giancarlo Esposito'].\nThought 2: To find the documentary, I can search Adam Clayton Powell (film).\nAction 2: Search[Adam Clayton Powell (film)]\nObservation 2: Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Richard Kilberg.\nThe film is about the rise and fall of influential African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired as part of the PBS series The American Experience.\nThought 3: Adam Clayton Powell (film) is a documentary about an African-American politician, not Finnish rock groups. So the documentary about Finnish rock groups must instead be The Saimaa Gesture.\nAction 3: Finish[The Saimaa Gesture]\nQuestion: What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?\nThought 1: I need to search Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, find their professions, then find the profession they have in common.\nAction 1: Search[Nicholas Ray]\nObservation 1: Nicholas Ray (born Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr., August 7, 1911 – June 16, 1979) was an American film director, screenwriter, and actor best known for the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause.\nThought 2: Professions of Nicholas Ray are director, screenwriter, and actor.

      "full_prompt": "Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Action, Observation steps. Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be three types: \n(1) Search[entity], which searches the exact entity on Wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists. If not, it will return some similar entities to search.\n(2) Lookup[keyword], which returns the next sentence containing keyword in the current passage.\n(3) Finish[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.\nHere are some examples.\n\n\nQuestion: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?\nThought 1: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.\nAction 1: Search[Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.\nThought 2: It does not mention the eastern sector. So I need to look up eastern sector.\nAction 2: Lookup[eastern sector]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.\nThought 3: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.\nAction 3: Search[High Plains]\nObservation 3: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions:\nThought 4: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).\nAction 4: Search[High Plains (United States)]\nObservation 4: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]\nThought 5: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.\nAction 5: Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.\nAction 1: Search[Milhouse]\nObservation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up \"named after\".\nAction 2: Lookup[named after]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. \nThought 3: Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.\nAction 3: Finish[Richard Nixon]\nQuestion: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?\nThought 1: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.\nAction 1: Search[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 1: Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell]. Similar: ['Adam Clayton Powell III', 'Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)', 'Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building', 'Isabel Washington Powell', 'Adam Powell', 'Adam Clayton Powell (film)', 'Giancarlo Esposito'].\nThought 2: To find the documentary, I can search Adam Clayton Powell (film).\nAction 2: Search[Adam Clayton Powell (film)]\nObservation 2: Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Richard Kilberg.\nThe film is about the rise and fall of influential African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired as part of the PBS series The American Experience.\nThought 3: Adam Clayton Powell (film) is a documentary about an African-American politician, not Finnish rock groups. So the documentary about Finnish rock groups must instead be The Saimaa Gesture.\nAction 3: Finish[The Saimaa Gesture]\nQuestion: What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?\nThought 1: I need to search Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, find their professions, then find the profession they have in common.\nAction 1: Search[Nicholas Ray]\nObservation 1: Nicholas Ray (born Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr., August 7, 1911 – June 16, 1979) was an American film director, screenwriter, and actor best known for the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause.\nThought 2: Professions of Nicholas Ray are director, screenwriter, and actor. I need to search Elia Kazan next and find his professions.\nAction 2: Search[Elia Kazan]\nObservation 2: Elia Kazan was an American film and theatre director, producer, screenwriter and actor.\nThought 3: Professions of Elia Kazan are director, producer, screenwriter, and actor. So profession Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common is director, screenwriter, and actor.\nAction 3: Finish[director, screenwriter, actor]\nQuestion: Which magazine was started first Arthur's Magazine or First for Women?\nThought 1: I need to search Arthur's Magazine and First for Women, and find which was started first.\nAction 1: Search[Arthur's Magazine]\nObservation 1: Arthur's Magazine (1844-1846) was an American literary periodical published in Philadelphia in the 19th century. \nThought 2: Arthur's Magazine was started in 1844.
