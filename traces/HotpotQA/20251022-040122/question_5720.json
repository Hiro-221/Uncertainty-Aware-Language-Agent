Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be three types: \n(1) Search[entity], which searches the exact entity on Wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists. If not, it will return some similar entities to search.\n(2) Lookup[keyword], which returns the next sentence containing keyword in the current passage.\n(3) Finish[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.\nHere are some examples.\n\n\nQuestion: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?\nThought 1: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.\nAction 1: Search[Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.\nThought 2: It does not mention the eastern sector.

According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the most plausible candidate for a core definition comes from the Institutes of Justinian, a 6th-century codification of Roman law, where justice is defined as \"the constant and perpetual will to render to each his due\".[1]. A society where justice has been achieved would be one in which individuals receive what they \"deserve\". The interpretation of what \"deserve\" means draws on a variety of fields and philosophical branches including ethics, rationality, law, religion, and fairness. The state may pursue justice by operating courts and enforcing their rulings..\nThought 2: Based on the above, I will provide an answer.\nAction 2: Finish[",

According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the most plausible candidate for a core definition comes from the Institutes of Justinian, a 6th-century codification of Roman law, where justice is defined as \"the constant and perpetual will to render to each his due\".[1]. A society where justice has been achieved would be one in which individuals receive what they \"deserve\". The interpretation of what \"deserve\" means draws on a variety of fields and philosophical branches including ethics, rationality, law, religion, and fairness. The state may pursue justice by operating courts and enforcing their rulings..\nThought 2:",

So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.\nAction 3: Search[High Plains]\nObservation 3: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions:\nThought 4: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).\nAction 4: Search[High Plains (United States)]\nObservation 4: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]\nThought 5: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.\nAction 5: Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who.

According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the most plausible candidate for a core definition comes from the Institutes of Justinian, a 6th-century codification of Roman law, where justice is defined as \"the constant and perpetual will to render to each his due\".[1]. A society where justice has been achieved would be one in which individuals receive what they \"deserve\". The interpretation of what \"deserve\" means draws on a variety of fields and philosophical branches including ethics, rationality, law, religion, and fairness. The state may pursue justice by operating courts and enforcing their rulings..\nThought 2: Justice is a concept. I need to search Justice (song) instead.\nAction 2: Search[Justice (song)]\nObservation 2: Rhythm of Life is the debut studio album by the Scottish musician Paul Haig, released in November 1983 by Island Records.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be three types: \n(1) Search[entity], which searches the exact entity on Wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists. If not, it will return some similar entities to search.\n(2) Lookup[keyword], which returns the next sentence containing keyword in the current passage.\n(3) Finish[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.\nHere are some examples.\n\n\nQuestion: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?\nThought 1: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.\nAction 1: Search[Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.\nThought 2: It does not mention the eastern sector.

According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the most plausible candidate for a core definition comes from the Institutes of Justinian, a 6th-century codification of Roman law, where justice is defined as \"the constant and perpetual will to render to each his due\".[1]. A society where justice has been achieved would be one in which individuals receive what they \"deserve\". The interpretation of what \"deserve\" means draws on a variety of fields and philosophical branches including ethics, rationality, law, religion, and fairness. The state may pursue justice by operating courts and enforcing their rulings..\nThought 2: Justice is a concept. I need to search Justice (song) instead.\nAction 2: Search[Justice (song)]\nObservation 2: Rhythm of Life is the debut studio album by the Scottish musician Paul Haig, released in November 1983 by Island Records.

The album features guest musicians such as Bernie Worrell of Parliament-Funkadelic, Anton Fier of the Feelies and the Golden Palominos, and Tom Bailey of Thompson Twins. Four singles were released from Rhythm of Life: \"Heaven Sent\", \"Never Give Up (Party Party)\", \"Justice\" and \"Blue for You\". The track \"Adoration\" was originally performed while Haig was still a member of the post-punk band Josef K.[1] The album spent 2 weeks on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at No.\nThought 3: Justice is a song. I need to search Justice (WWE) instead.\nAction 3: Search[Justice (WWE)]\nObservation 3: Could not find Justice (WWE). Similar: ['List of WWE pay-per-view and livestreaming supercards', 'Spike Dudley (category WWF/WWE Hardcore Champions)', 'List of WWE Champions', \"Saturday Night's Main Event (redirect from WWE Saturday Night Main Event)\", 'The Shield (professional wrestling) (redirect from The Shield (WWE))'].\nThought 4: Based on the above, I will provide an answer.\nAction 4: Finish[",

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be three types: \n(1) Search[entity], which searches the exact entity on Wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists. If not, it will return some similar entities to search.\n(2) Lookup[keyword], which returns the next sentence containing keyword in the current passage.\n(3) Finish[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.\nHere are some examples.\n\n\nQuestion: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?\nThought 1: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.\nAction 1: Search[Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.\nThought 2: It does not mention the eastern sector.

According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the most plausible candidate for a core definition comes from the Institutes of Justinian, a 6th-century codification of Roman law, where justice is defined as \"the constant and perpetual will to render to each his due\".[1]. A society where justice has been achieved would be one in which individuals receive what they \"deserve\". The interpretation of what \"deserve\" means draws on a variety of fields and philosophical branches including ethics, rationality, law, religion, and fairness. The state may pursue justice by operating courts and enforcing their rulings..\nThought 2: Justice is a concept. I need to search Justice (song) instead.\nAction 2: Search[Justice (song)]\nObservation 2: Rhythm of Life is the debut studio album by the Scottish musician Paul Haig, released in November 1983 by Island Records.

The album features guest musicians such as Bernie Worrell of Parliament-Funkadelic, Anton Fier of the Feelies and the Golden Palominos, and Tom Bailey of Thompson Twins. Four singles were released from Rhythm of Life: \"Heaven Sent\", \"Never Give Up (Party Party)\", \"Justice\" and \"Blue for You\". The track \"Adoration\" was originally performed while Haig was still a member of the post-punk band Josef K.[1] The album spent 2 weeks on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at No.\nThought 3: Justice is a song. I need to search Justice (WWE) instead.\nAction 3: Search[Justice (WWE)]\nObservation 3: Could not find Justice (WWE). Similar: ['List of WWE pay-per-view and livestreaming supercards', 'Spike Dudley (category WWF/WWE Hardcore Champions)', 'List of WWE Champions', \"Saturday Night's Main Event (redirect from WWE Saturday Night Main Event)\", 'The Shield (professional wrestling) (redirect from The Shield (WWE))'].\nThought 4: To find the WWE event, I can search List of WWE pay-per-view and livestreaming supercards.\nAction 4: Search[List of WWE pay-per-view and livestreaming supercards]\nObservation 4: This is a list of WWE pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming supercards, detailing all professional wrestling cards promoted by the American promotion available on traditional PPV outlets, and livestreaming services such as the WWE Network, Peacock, Netflix, ESPN, and YouTube.. Since 2022, to emphasize the availability of these events via digital platforms such as WWE Network and other streaming services that hold rights to its content (such as ESPN in the United States), WWE began to refer to all PPV and livestreaming events as \"Premium Live Events\" (PLE).[1]. The American professional wrestling promotion WWE (formerly WWF) has been broadcasting pay-per-view (PPV) events since the mid 1980s, when its classic \"Big Four\" events (Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series) were first established between 1985 and 1989—with the company's very first PPV being WrestleMania in 1985. The company's PPV lineup expanded to a monthly basis in 1995 following the introduction of the In Your House series of pay-per views (which were replaced by standalone ppvs in 1999) before expanding even further in the mid-2000s during the first WWE brand extension. In addition, WWE produced international PPVs not available in the United States between 1997 and 2003.\nThought 5: Based on the above, I will provide an answer.\nAction 5: Finish[",

According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the most plausible candidate for a core definition comes from the Institutes of Justinian, a 6th-century codification of Roman law, where justice is defined as \"the constant and perpetual will to render to each his due\".[1]. A society where justice has been achieved would be one in which individuals receive what they \"deserve\". The interpretation of what \"deserve\" means draws on a variety of fields and philosophical branches including ethics, rationality, law, religion, and fairness. The state may pursue justice by operating courts and enforcing their rulings..\nThought 2: Justice is a concept. I need to search Justice (song) instead.\nAction 2: Search[Justice (song)]\nObservation 2: Rhythm of Life is the debut studio album by the Scottish musician Paul Haig, released in November 1983 by Island Records.

The company's PPV lineup expanded to a monthly basis in 1995 following the introduction of the In Your House series of pay-per views (which were replaced by standalone ppvs in 1999) before expanding even further in the mid-2000s during the first WWE brand extension. In addition, WWE produced international PPVs not available in the United States between 1997 and 2003.\nThought 5:",

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be three types: \n(1) Search[entity], which searches the exact entity on Wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists. If not, it will return some similar entities to search.\n(2) Lookup[keyword], which returns the next sentence containing keyword in the current passage.\n(3) Finish[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.\nHere are some examples.\n\n\nQuestion: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?\nThought 1: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.\nAction 1: Search[Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.\nThought 2: It does not mention the eastern sector.

According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the most plausible candidate for a core definition comes from the Institutes of Justinian, a 6th-century codification of Roman law, where justice is defined as \"the constant and perpetual will to render to each his due\".[1]. A society where justice has been achieved would be one in which individuals receive what they \"deserve\". The interpretation of what \"deserve\" means draws on a variety of fields and philosophical branches including ethics, rationality, law, religion, and fairness. The state may pursue justice by operating courts and enforcing their rulings..\nThought 2: Justice is a concept. I need to search Justice (song) instead.\nAction 2: Search[Justice (song)]\nObservation 2: Rhythm of Life is the debut studio album by the Scottish musician Paul Haig, released in November 1983 by Island Records.

The album features guest musicians such as Bernie Worrell of Parliament-Funkadelic, Anton Fier of the Feelies and the Golden Palominos, and Tom Bailey of Thompson Twins. Four singles were released from Rhythm of Life: \"Heaven Sent\", \"Never Give Up (Party Party)\", \"Justice\" and \"Blue for You\". The track \"Adoration\" was originally performed while Haig was still a member of the post-punk band Josef K.[1] The album spent 2 weeks on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at No.\nThought 3: Justice is a song.

According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the most plausible candidate for a core definition comes from the Institutes of Justinian, a 6th-century codification of Roman law, where justice is defined as \"the constant and perpetual will to render to each his due\".[1]. A society where justice has been achieved would be one in which individuals receive what they \"deserve\". The interpretation of what \"deserve\" means draws on a variety of fields and philosophical branches including ethics, rationality, law, religion, and fairness. The state may pursue justice by operating courts and enforcing their rulings..\nThought 2: Justice is a concept. I need to search Justice (song) instead.\nAction 2: Search[Justice (song)]\nObservation 2: Rhythm of Life is the debut studio album by the Scottish musician Paul Haig, released in November 1983 by Island Records.

The album features guest musicians such as Bernie Worrell of Parliament-Funkadelic, Anton Fier of the Feelies and the Golden Palominos, and Tom Bailey of Thompson Twins. Four singles were released from Rhythm of Life: \"Heaven Sent\", \"Never Give Up (Party Party)\", \"Justice\" and \"Blue for You\". The track \"Adoration\" was originally performed while Haig was still a member of the post-punk band Josef K.[1] The album spent 2 weeks on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at No.\nThought 3: Justice is a song. I need to search Justice (WWE) instead.\nAction 3: Search[Justice (WWE)]\nObservation 3: Could not find Justice (WWE). Similar: ['List of WWE pay-per-view and livestreaming supercards', 'Spike Dudley (category WWF/WWE Hardcore Champions)', 'List of WWE Champions', \"Saturday Night's Main Event (redirect from WWE Saturday Night Main Event)\", 'The Shield (professional wrestling) (redirect from The Shield (WWE))'].\nThought 4: To find the WWE event, I can search List of WWE pay-per-view and livestreaming supercards.\nAction 4: Search[List of WWE pay-per-view and livestreaming supercards]\nObservation 4: This is a list of WWE pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming supercards, detailing all professional wrestling cards promoted by the American promotion available on traditional PPV outlets, and livestreaming services such as the WWE Network, Peacock, Netflix, ESPN, and YouTube.. Since 2022, to emphasize the availability of these events via digital platforms such as WWE Network and other streaming services that hold rights to its content (such as ESPN in the United States), WWE began to refer to all PPV and livestreaming events as \"Premium Live Events\" (PLE).[1]. The American professional wrestling promotion WWE (formerly WWF) has been broadcasting pay-per-view (PPV) events since the mid 1980s, when its classic \"Big Four\" events (Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series) were first established between 1985 and 1989—with the company's very first PPV being WrestleMania in 1985. The company's PPV lineup expanded to a monthly basis in 1995 following the introduction of the In Your House series of pay-per views (which were replaced by standalone ppvs in 1999) before expanding even further in the mid-2000s during the first WWE brand extension. In addition, WWE produced international PPVs not available in the United States between 1997 and 2003.\nThought 5: I need to search List of WWE pay-per-view and livestreaming supercards (2020s) instead.\nAction 5: Search[List of WWE pay-per-view and livestreaming supercards (2020s)]\nObservation 5: Could not find List of WWE pay-per-view and livestreaming supercards (2020s).

According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the most plausible candidate for a core definition comes from the Institutes of Justinian, a 6th-century codification of Roman law, where justice is defined as \"the constant and perpetual will to render to each his due\".[1]. A society where justice has been achieved would be one in which individuals receive what they \"deserve\".

Since 2022, to emphasize the availability of these events via digital platforms such as WWE Network and other streaming services that hold rights to its content (such as ESPN in the United States), WWE began to refer to all PPV and livestreaming events as \"Premium Live Events\" (PLE).[1]. The American professional wrestling promotion WWE (formerly WWF) has been broadcasting pay-per-view (PPV) events since the mid 1980s, when its classic \"Big Four\" events (Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series) were first established between 1985 and 1989—with the company's very first PPV being WrestleMania in 1985. The company's PPV lineup expanded to a monthly basis in 1995 following the introduction of the In Your House series of pay-per views (which were replaced by standalone ppvs in 1999) before expanding even further in the mid-2000s during the first WWE brand extension.

According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the most plausible candidate for a core definition comes from the Institutes of Justinian, a 6th-century codification of Roman law, where justice is defined as \"the constant and perpetual will to render to each his due\".[1]. A society where justice has been achieved would be one in which individuals receive what they \"deserve\". The interpretation of what \"deserve\" means draws on a variety of fields and philosophical branches including ethics, rationality, law, religion, and fairness. The state may pursue justice by operating courts and enforcing their rulings..\nThought 2: Justice is a concept.

Since 2022, to emphasize the availability of these events via digital platforms such as WWE Network and other streaming services that hold rights to its content (such as ESPN in the United States), WWE began to refer to all PPV and livestreaming events as \"Premium Live Events\" (PLE).[1]. The American professional wrestling promotion WWE (formerly WWF) has been broadcasting pay-per-view (PPV) events since the mid 1980s, when its classic \"Big Four\" events (Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series) were first established between 1985 and 1989—with the company's very first PPV being WrestleMania in 1985. The company's PPV lineup expanded to a monthly basis in 1995 following the introduction of the In Your House series of pay-per views (which were replaced by standalone ppvs in 1999) before expanding even further in the mid-2000s during the first WWE brand extension.

According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the most plausible candidate for a core definition comes from the Institutes of Justinian, a 6th-century codification of Roman law, where justice is defined as \"the constant and perpetual will to render to each his due\".[1]. A society where justice has been achieved would be one in which individuals receive what they \"deserve\". The interpretation of what \"deserve\" means draws on a variety of fields and philosophical branches including ethics, rationality, law, religion, and fairness. The state may pursue justice by operating courts and enforcing their rulings..\nThought 2: Justice is a concept. I need to search Justice (song) instead.\nAction 2: Search[Justice (song)]\nObservation 2: Rhythm of Life is the debut studio album by the Scottish musician Paul Haig, released in November 1983 by Island Records.

The album features guest musicians such as Bernie Worrell of Parliament-Funkadelic, Anton Fier of the Feelies and the Golden Palominos, and Tom Bailey of Thompson Twins. Four singles were released from Rhythm of Life: \"Heaven Sent\", \"Never Give Up (Party Party)\", \"Justice\" and \"Blue for You\". The track \"Adoration\" was originally performed while Haig was still a member of the post-punk band Josef K.[1] The album spent 2 weeks on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at No.\nThought 3: Justice is a song.

Since 2022, to emphasize the availability of these events via digital platforms such as WWE Network and other streaming services that hold rights to its content (such as ESPN in the United States), WWE began to refer to all PPV and livestreaming events as \"Premium Live Events\" (PLE).[1]. The American professional wrestling promotion WWE (formerly WWF) has been broadcasting pay-per-view (PPV) events since the mid 1980s, when its classic \"Big Four\" events (Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series) were first established between 1985 and 1989—with the company's very first PPV being WrestleMania in 1985. The company's PPV lineup expanded to a monthly basis in 1995 following the introduction of the In Your House series of pay-per views (which were replaced by standalone ppvs in 1999) before expanding even further in the mid-2000s during the first WWE brand extension.

According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the most plausible candidate for a core definition comes from the Institutes of Justinian, a 6th-century codification of Roman law, where justice is defined as \"the constant and perpetual will to render to each his due\".[1]. A society where justice has been achieved would be one in which individuals receive what they \"deserve\". The interpretation of what \"deserve\" means draws on a variety of fields and philosophical branches including ethics, rationality, law, religion, and fairness. The state may pursue justice by operating courts and enforcing their rulings..\nThought 2: Justice is a concept.

Since 2022, to emphasize the availability of these events via digital platforms such as WWE Network and other streaming services that hold rights to its content (such as ESPN in the United States), WWE began to refer to all PPV and livestreaming events as \"Premium Live Events\" (PLE).[1]. The American professional wrestling promotion WWE (formerly WWF) has been broadcasting pay-per-view (PPV) events since the mid 1980s, when its classic \"Big Four\" events (Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series) were first established between 1985 and 1989—with the company's very first PPV being WrestleMania in 1985. The company's PPV lineup expanded to a monthly basis in 1995 following the introduction of the In Your House series of pay-per views (which were replaced by standalone ppvs in 1999) before expanding even further in the mid-2000s during the first WWE brand extension.

According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the most plausible candidate for a core definition comes from the Institutes of Justinian, a 6th-century codification of Roman law, where justice is defined as \"the constant and perpetual will to render to each his due\".[1]. A society where justice has been achieved would be one in which individuals receive what they \"deserve\". The interpretation of what \"deserve\" means draws on a variety of fields and philosophical branches including ethics, rationality, law, religion, and fairness. The state may pursue justice by operating courts and enforcing their rulings..\nThought 2: Justice is a concept.

Since 2022, to emphasize the availability of these events via digital platforms such as WWE Network and other streaming services that hold rights to its content (such as ESPN in the United States), WWE began to refer to all PPV and livestreaming events as \"Premium Live Events\" (PLE).[1]. The American professional wrestling promotion WWE (formerly WWF) has been broadcasting pay-per-view (PPV) events since the mid 1980s, when its classic \"Big Four\" events (Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series) were first established between 1985 and 1989—with the company's very first PPV being WrestleMania in 1985. The company's PPV lineup expanded to a monthly basis in 1995 following the introduction of the In Your House series of pay-per views (which were replaced by standalone ppvs in 1999) before expanding even further in the mid-2000s during the first WWE brand extension. In addition, WWE produced international PPVs not available in the United States between 1997 and 2003.\nThought 5: I need to search List of WWE pay-per-view and livestreaming supercards (2020s) instead.\nAction 5: Search[List of WWE pay-per-view and livestreaming supercards (2020s)]\nObservation 5: Could not find List of WWE pay-per-view and livestreaming supercards (2020s).

According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the most plausible candidate for a core definition comes from the Institutes of Justinian, a 6th-century codification of Roman law, where justice is defined as \"the constant and perpetual will to render to each his due\".[1]. A society where justice has been achieved would be one in which individuals receive what they \"deserve\". The interpretation of what \"deserve\" means draws on a variety of fields and philosophical branches including ethics, rationality, law, religion, and fairness. The state may pursue justice by operating courts and enforcing their rulings..\nThought 2: Justice is a concept. I need to search Justice (song) instead.\nAction 2: Search[Justice (song)]\nObservation 2: Rhythm of Life is the debut studio album by the Scottish musician Paul Haig, released in November 1983 by Island Records.

The album features guest musicians such as Bernie Worrell of Parliament-Funkadelic, Anton Fier of the Feelies and the Golden Palominos, and Tom Bailey of Thompson Twins. Four singles were released from Rhythm of Life: \"Heaven Sent\", \"Never Give Up (Party Party)\", \"Justice\" and \"Blue for You\". The track \"Adoration\" was originally performed while Haig was still a member of the post-punk band Josef K.[1] The album spent 2 weeks on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at No.\nThought 3: Justice is a song.

Since 2022, to emphasize the availability of these events via digital platforms such as WWE Network and other streaming services that hold rights to its content (such as ESPN in the United States), WWE began to refer to all PPV and livestreaming events as \"Premium Live Events\" (PLE).[1]. The American professional wrestling promotion WWE (formerly WWF) has been broadcasting pay-per-view (PPV) events since the mid 1980s, when its classic \"Big Four\" events (Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series) were first established between 1985 and 1989—with the company's very first PPV being WrestleMania in 1985. The company's PPV lineup expanded to a monthly basis in 1995 following the introduction of the In Your House series of pay-per views (which were replaced by standalone ppvs in 1999) before expanding even further in the mid-2000s during the first WWE brand extension. In addition, WWE produced international PPVs not available in the United States between 1997 and 2003.\nThought 5: I need to search List of WWE pay-per-view and livestreaming supercards (2020s) instead.\nAction 5: Search[List of WWE pay-per-view and livestreaming supercards (2020s)]\nObservation 5: Could not find List of WWE pay-per-view and livestreaming supercards (2020s).

  "traj": "Question: The song Justice was used for a WWE event that took place on what day ?\nThought 1:Let's think step by step. Justice was used for a WWE event that took place on 2008-06-29.\nAnswer: 2008-06-29\nAction 1: MeasureUncertainty [2008-06-29]\nObservation 1: Answer’s uncertainty is 2.4, which falls outside the acceptable threshold of 1.79.\nThought 2: Based on the uncertainty, I need to use an external tool to solve the question.\nAction 2: Activate Tool.\nThought 3: I need to search Justice and find the WWE event that took place on the day.\nAction 3: Search[Justice]\nObservation 3: In its broadest sense, justice is the idea that individuals should be treated fairly. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the most plausible candidate for a core definition comes from the Institutes of Justinian, a 6th-century codification of Roman law, where justice is defined as \"the constant and perpetual will to render to each his due\".[1]. A society where justice has been achieved would be one in which individuals receive what they \"deserve\". The interpretation of what \"deserve\" means draws on a variety of fields and philosophical branches including ethics, rationality, law, religion, and fairness. The state may pursue justice by operating courts and enforcing their rulings..\nThought 4: Justice is a concept. I need to search Justice (song) instead.\nAction 4: Search[Justice (song)]\nObservation 4: Rhythm of Life is the debut studio album by the Scottish musician Paul Haig, released in November 1983 by Island Records. It was recorded at Sigma Sound Studios in New York City and RAK Studios in London with renowned record producer Alex Sadkin, known for his work on multiple albums by Grace Jones, and Thompson Twins. The album features guest musicians such as Bernie Worrell of Parliament-Funkadelic, Anton Fier of the Feelies and the Golden Palominos, and Tom Bailey of Thompson Twins. Four singles were released from Rhythm of Life: \"Heaven Sent\", \"Never Give Up (Party Party)\", \"Justice\" and \"Blue for You\". The track \"Adoration\" was originally performed while Haig was still a member of the post-punk band Josef K.[1] The album spent 2 weeks on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at No.\nThought 5: Justice is a song.

Since 2022, to emphasize the availability of these events via digital platforms such as WWE Network and other streaming services that hold rights to its content (such as ESPN in the United States), WWE began to refer to all PPV and livestreaming events as \"Premium Live Events\" (PLE).[1]. The American professional wrestling promotion WWE (formerly WWF) has been broadcasting pay-per-view (PPV) events since the mid 1980s, when its classic \"Big Four\" events (Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series) were first established between 1985 and 1989—with the company's very first PPV being WrestleMania in 1985. The company's PPV lineup expanded to a monthly basis in 1995 following the introduction of the In Your House series of pay-per views (which were replaced by standalone ppvs in 1999) before expanding even further in the mid-2000s during the first WWE brand extension. In addition, WWE produced international PPVs not available in the United States between 1997 and 2003.\nThought 7: I need to search List of WWE pay-per-view and livestreaming supercards (2020s) instead.\nAction 7: Search[List of WWE pay-per-view and livestreaming supercards (2020s)]\nObservation 7: Could not find List of WWE pay-per-view and livestreaming supercards (2020s).
