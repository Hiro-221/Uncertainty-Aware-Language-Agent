Chien-Shiung Wu's expertise in experimental physics evoked comparisons to Marie Curie. Marie Curie passed away in 1934.\nAnswer: 1934\nAction 1: MeasureUncertainty [1934]\nObservation 1: Answer's uncertainty is 1.61, which falls within the acceptable threshold of 1.79.\nThought 2: Based on the uncertainty, answer is kept.\nAction 2: Keep Answer.\nAnswer: 1934",
