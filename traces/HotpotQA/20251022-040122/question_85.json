Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be three types: \n(1) Search[entity], which searches the exact entity on Wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists. If not, it will return some similar entities to search.\n(2) Lookup[keyword], which returns the next sentence containing keyword in the current passage.\n(3) Finish[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.\nHere are some examples.\n\n\nQuestion: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?\nThought 1: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.\nAction 1: Search[Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.\nThought 2: It does not mention the eastern sector. So I need to look up eastern sector.\nAction 2: Lookup[eastern sector]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.\nThought 3: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.\nAction 3: Search[High Plains]\nObservation 3: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions:\nThought 4: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).\nAction 4: Search[High Plains (United States)]\nObservation 4: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]\nThought 5: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.\nAction 5: Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.\nAction 1: Search[Milhouse]\nObservation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up \"named after\".\nAction 2: Lookup[named after]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. \nThought 3: Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.\nAction 3: Finish[Richard Nixon]\nQuestion: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?\nThought 1: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.\nAction 1: Search[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 1: Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell]. Similar: ['Adam Clayton Powell III', 'Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)', 'Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building', 'Isabel Washington Powell', 'Adam Powell', 'Adam Clayton Powell (film)', 'Giancarlo Esposito'].\nThought 2: To find the documentary, I can search Adam Clayton Powell (film).\nAction 2: Search[Adam Clayton Powell (film)]\nObservation 2: Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Richard Kilberg.\nThe film is about the rise and fall of influential African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired as part of the PBS series The American Experience.\nThought 3: Adam Clayton Powell (film) is a documentary about an African-American politician, not Finnish rock groups. So the documentary about Finnish rock groups must instead be The Saimaa Gesture.\nAction 3: Finish[The Saimaa Gesture]\nQuestion: What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?\nThought 1: I need to search Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, find their professions, then find the profession they have in common.\nAction 1: Search[Nicholas Ray]\nObservation 1: Nicholas Ray (born Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr., August 7, 1911 – June 16, 1979) was an American film director, screenwriter, and actor best known for the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause.\nThought 2: Professions of Nicholas Ray are director, screenwriter, and actor.

He was the first delegate from the Oregon Territory to the United States Congress and was instrumental in the passage of the Donation Land Claim Act.. Thurston was born in Monmouth, Maine, and grew up in Peru, Maine; his father died when he was young.[1] After attending Dartmouth College, he graduated in 1843 from Bowdoin College in Maine, graduating with honors.[1] He then studied law under Robert Dunlap.[1] Thurston met Elizabeth McLench in college and married her after graduating.[2] The couple moved to Burlington, Iowa in 1845.[3]. Thurston came to the Oregon Country in 1847 as an emigrant over the Oregon Trail. In Oregon he settled in Hillsboro, where he practiced law.[1] Then in 1848 he was elected to the Provisional Legislature from Tuality District where he served with fellow Hillsboro resident David Hill.[4] In 1849, Thurston was selected to represent the Oregon Territory in the U.S.\nThought 2: Samuel Thurston was the first delegate from the Oregon Territory to the United States Congress. So the region that existed as an organized incorporated territory of the United States is Oregon Territory. I need to search Oregon Territory next.\nAction 2: Search[Oregon Territory]\nObservation 2: The Territory of Oregon was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from August 14, 1848,[1] until February 14, 1859, when the southwestern portion of the territory was admitted to the Union as the State of Oregon. Originally claimed by several countries (see Oregon Country), Spanish \"El Orejón\"[citation needed] was part of the Territorio de Nutca (1789–1795), later in the 19th century, the region was divided between the British Empire and the US in 1846. When established, the territory encompassed an area that included the current states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho, as well as parts of Wyoming and Montana. The capital of the territory was first Oregon City, then Salem, followed briefly by Corvallis, then back to Salem, which became the state capital upon Oregon's admission to the Union.. Originally inhabited by Native Americans, the region that became the Oregon Territory was explored by Europeans first by sea.\nThought 3: Based on the above, I will provide an answer.\nAction 3: Finish[",

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be three types: \n(1) Search[entity], which searches the exact entity on Wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists. If not, it will return some similar entities to search.\n(2) Lookup[keyword], which returns the next sentence containing keyword in the current passage.\n(3) Finish[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.\nHere are some examples.\n\n\nQuestion: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?\nThought 1: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.\nAction 1: Search[Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.\nThought 2: It does not mention the eastern sector. So I need to look up eastern sector.\nAction 2: Lookup[eastern sector]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.\nThought 3: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains.

Thurston was born in Monmouth, Maine, and grew up in Peru, Maine; his father died when he was young.[1] After attending Dartmouth College, he graduated in 1843 from Bowdoin College in Maine, graduating with honors.[1] He then studied law under Robert Dunlap.[1] Thurston met Elizabeth McLench in college and married her after graduating.[2] The couple moved to Burlington, Iowa in 1845.[3]. Thurston came to the Oregon Country in 1847 as an emigrant over the Oregon Trail. In Oregon he settled in Hillsboro, where he practiced law.[1] Then in 1848 he was elected to the Provisional Legislature from Tuality District where he served with fellow Hillsboro resident David Hill.[4] In 1849, Thurston was selected to represent the Oregon Territory in the U.S.\nThought 2: Samuel Thurston was the first delegate from the Oregon Territory to the United States Congress. So the region that existed as an organized incorporated territory of the United States is Oregon Territory. I need to search Oregon Territory next.\nAction 2: Search[Oregon Territory]\nObservation 2: The Territory of Oregon was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from August 14, 1848,[1] until February 14, 1859, when the southwestern portion of the territory was admitted to the Union as the State of Oregon. Originally claimed by several countries (see Oregon Country), Spanish \"El Orejón\"[citation needed] was part of the Territorio de Nutca (1789–1795), later in the 19th century, the region was divided between the British Empire and the US in 1846. When established, the territory encompassed an area that included the current states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho, as well as parts of Wyoming and Montana. The capital of the territory was first Oregon City, then Salem, followed briefly by Corvallis, then back to Salem, which became the state capital upon Oregon's admission to the Union.. Originally inhabited by Native Americans, the region that became the Oregon Territory was explored by Europeans first by sea.\nThought 3: Oregon Territory existed from August 14, 1848, until February 14, 1859. So the answer is August 14, 1848, until February 14, 1859.\nAction 3: Finish[August 14, 1848, until February 14, 1859]\nObservation 3: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\nThought 4: Based on the above, I will provide an answer.\nAction 4: Finish[",

Oregon Territory existed as an organized incorporated territory of the United States from 1848 to 1859. Samuel Thurston served as its first delegate from 1848 to 1851. So the answer is 1848 to 1851.\nAnswer: 1848 to 1851\nAction 1: MeasureUncertainty [1848 to 1851]\nObservation 1: Answer’s uncertainty is 2.4, which falls outside the acceptable threshold of 1.79.\nThought 2: Based on the uncertainty, I need to use an external tool to solve the question.\nAction 2: Activate Tool.\nThought 3: I need to search Samuel Thurston, find the region that existed as an organized incorporated territory of the United States, then find when it existed.\nAction 3: Search[Samuel Thurston]\nObservation 3: Samuel Royal Thurston (April 15, 1816 – April 9, 1851) was an American pioneer, lawyer and politician. He was the first delegate from the Oregon Territory to the United States Congress and was instrumental in the passage of the Donation Land Claim Act.. Thurston was born in Monmouth, Maine, and grew up in Peru, Maine; his father died when he was young.[1] After attending Dartmouth College, he graduated in 1843 from Bowdoin College in Maine, graduating with honors.[1] He then studied law under Robert Dunlap.[1] Thurston met Elizabeth McLench in college and married her after graduating.[2] The couple moved to Burlington, Iowa in 1845.[3]. Thurston came to the Oregon Country in 1847 as an emigrant over the Oregon Trail. In Oregon he settled in Hillsboro, where he practiced law.[1] Then in 1848 he was elected to the Provisional Legislature from Tuality District where he served with fellow Hillsboro resident David Hill.[4] In 1849, Thurston was selected to represent the Oregon Territory in the U.S.\nThought 4: Samuel Thurston was the first delegate from the Oregon Territory to the United States Congress. So the region that existed as an organized incorporated territory of the United States is Oregon Territory. I need to search Oregon Territory next.\nAction 4: Search[Oregon Territory]\nObservation 4: The Territory of Oregon was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from August 14, 1848,[1] until February 14, 1859, when the southwestern portion of the territory was admitted to the Union as the State of Oregon. Originally claimed by several countries (see Oregon Country), Spanish \"El Orejón\"[citation needed] was part of the Territorio de Nutca (1789–1795), later in the 19th century, the region was divided between the British Empire and the US in 1846. When established, the territory encompassed an area that included the current states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho, as well as parts of Wyoming and Montana. The capital of the territory was first Oregon City, then Salem, followed briefly by Corvallis, then back to Salem, which became the state capital upon Oregon's admission to the Union.. Originally inhabited by Native Americans, the region that became the Oregon Territory was explored by Europeans first by sea.\nThought 5: Oregon Territory existed from August 14, 1848, until February 14, 1859.
