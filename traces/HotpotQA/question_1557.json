So I need to look up eastern sector.\nAction 2: Lookup[eastern sector]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.\nThought 3: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.\nAction 3: Search[High Plains]\nObservation 3: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions:\nThought 4: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).\nAction 4: Search[High Plains (United States)]\nObservation 4: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]\nThought 5: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.\nAction 5: Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.\nAction 1: Search[Milhouse]\nObservation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up \"named after\".\nAction 2: Lookup[named after]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. \nThought 3: Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.\nAction 3: Finish[Richard Nixon]\nQuestion: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?\nThought 1: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.\nAction 1: Search[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 1: Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell]. Similar: ['Adam Clayton Powell III', 'Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)', 'Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building', 'Isabel Washington Powell', 'Adam Powell', 'Adam Clayton Powell (film)', 'Giancarlo Esposito'].\nThought 2: To find the documentary, I can search Adam Clayton Powell (film).\nAction 2: Search[Adam Clayton Powell (film)]\nObservation 2: Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Richard Kilberg.\nThe film is about the rise and fall of influential African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired as part of the PBS series The American Experience.\nThought 3: Adam Clayton Powell (film) is a documentary about an African-American politician, not Finnish rock groups.

Hardley Flood is an area of lagoons that support populations of the waterfowl that are a medium sized version of the animal. So the answer is a medium sized version of the animal.\nAnswer: a medium sized version of the animal\nAction 1: MeasureUncertainty [a medium sized version of the animal]\nObservation 1: Answer’s uncertainty is 2.08, which falls outside the acceptable threshold of 1.79.\nThought 2: Based on the uncertainty, I need to use an external tool to solve the question.\nAction 2: Activate Tool.\nThought 3: I need to search Hardley Flood, find the waterfowl that are a medium sized version of what animal, then find the animal.\nAction 3: Search[Hardley Flood]\nObservation 3: Hardley Flood is a 49.8-hectare (123-acre) biological Site of Special Scientific Interest near Loddon, between Norwich, Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, England.[1][2] It is part of the Broadland Ramsar site[3] and Special Protection Area,[4] and The Broads Special Area of Conservation.[5]. This area of tidal lagoons and reedbeds provides a spillway for the River Chet. The reedbeds provide nesting sites for birds, including nationally important populations of several breeding birds. Three rare flies have been recorded, Elachiptera uniseta, Elachiptera scrobiculata and Lonchoptera scutellata.[6]. The site is open to  the public..\nThought 4: Hardley Flood is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. I need to look up waterfowl.\nAction 4: Lookup[waterfowl]\nObservation 4: No more results.\n\nThought 5: I need to look up bird.\nAction 5: Lookup[bird]\nObservation 5: (Result 1 / 1) The reedbeds provide nesting sites for birds, including nationally important populations of several breeding birds.\nThought 6: The reedbeds provide nesting sites for birds. I need to look up breeding birds.\nAction 6: Lookup[breeding birds]\nObservation 6: (Result 1 / 1) The reedbeds provide nesting sites for birds, including nationally important populations of several breeding birds.\nThought 7: The reedbeds provide nesting sites for birds, including nationally important populations of several breeding birds. I need to look up several breeding birds.\nAction 7: Lookup[several breeding birds]\nObservation 7: (Result 1 / 1) The reedbeds provide nesting sites for birds, including nationally important populations of several breeding birds.\nThought 8: The reedbeds provide nesting sites for birds, including nationally important populations of several breeding birds. I need to look up nationally important populations.\nAction 8: Lookup[nationally important populations]\nObservation 8: (Result 1 / 1) The reedbeds provide nesting sites for birds, including nationally important populations of several breeding birds.\nThought 9: The reedbeds provide nesting sites for birds, including nationally important populations of several breeding birds. I need to look up several breeding birds.\nAction 9: Lookup[several breeding birds]\nObservation 9: (Result 1 / 1) The reedbeds provide nesting sites for birds, including nationally important populations of several breeding birds.\nThought 10: Returned tool-use answer is invalid, I need to use the backoff answer.\nAction 10: Use Backoff Answer.\nAnswer: a medium sized version of the animal",
