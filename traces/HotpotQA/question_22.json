So I need to look up eastern sector.\nAction 2: Lookup[eastern sector]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.\nThought 3: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.\nAction 3: Search[High Plains]\nObservation 3: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions:\nThought 4: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).\nAction 4: Search[High Plains (United States)]\nObservation 4: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]\nThought 5: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.\nAction 5: Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who.

        "traj": "Question: What language was spoken by the Native American people whose principal town was Anhaica?\nThought 1:Let's think step by step. The Native American people whose principal town was Anhaica are Apalachee. Apalachee language is a Muskogean language. So the language spoken by the Native American people whose principal town was Anhaica is a Muskogean language.\nAnswer: a Muskogean language\nAction 1: MeasureUncertainty [a Muskogean language]\nObservation 1: Answer’s uncertainty is 1.79, which falls outside the acceptable threshold of 1.79.\nThought 2: Based on the uncertainty, I need to use an external tool to solve the question.\nAction 2: Activate Tool.\nThought 3: I need to search Anhaica, find the Native American people whose principal town was Anhaica, then find the language they spoke.\nAction 3: Search[Anhaica]\nObservation 3: Anhaica (also known as Iviahica, Yniahico, and pueblo of Apalache) was the principal town of the Apalachee people, located in what is now Tallahassee, Florida. In the early period of Spanish colonization, it was the capital of the Apalachee Province. The site, now known as Martin Archaeological Site, was rediscovered in 1988.. In the late pre-invasion era the site became the capital of the Apalachee after the abandonment of the former capital, the Lake Jackson Mounds Site, in approximately 1500. The fact that no platform mounds are found at Anhaica may indicate a political change.[citation needed] Either Anhiaca was not occupied long enough for the construction of mounds to begin, or mounds were no longer being built.\nThought 4: The Native American people whose principal town was Anhaica is Apalachee. I need to search Apalachee next and find the language they spoke.\nAction 4: Search[Apalachee]\nObservation 4: The Apalachee were an Indigenous people of the Southeastern Woodlands, specifically an Indigenous people of Florida, who lived in the Florida Panhandle until the early 18th century.[1] They lived between the Aucilla River and Ochlockonee River,[2] at the head of Apalachee Bay, an area known as the Apalachee Province. They spoke a Muskogean language called Apalachee, which is now extinct.. The Apalachee occupied the site of Velda Mound starting about 1450 CE,[citation needed] but they had mostly abandoned it when Spanish started settlements in the 17th century. They first encountered Spanish explorers in 1528, when the Narváez expedition arrived. Their tribal enemies, European diseases, and European encroachment severely reduced their population..\nThought 5: The language they spoke is Apalachee.\nAction 5: Finish[Apalachee]\nObservation 5: Episode finished, reward = 1\nThought 6: Let me check the uncertainty of the returned answer.\nAction 6: MeasureUncertainty [Apalachee]\nObservation 7: Answer’s uncertainty is 1.39, which falls within the acceptable threshold of 1.79.\nThought 7: Based on the uncertainty, answer is kept.\nAction 7: Keep Answer.\nAnswer: Apalachee",
