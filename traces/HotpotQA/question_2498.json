Callicoma has 1 species. 2 (Clianthus) > 1 (Callicoma), so Clianthus has more species.\nAnswer: Clianthus\nAction 1: MeasureUncertainty [Clianthus]\nObservation 1: Answer’s uncertainty is 1.39, which falls within the acceptable threshold of 1.79.\nThought 2: Based on the uncertainty, answer is kept.\nAction 2: Keep Answer.\nAnswer: Clianthus",
