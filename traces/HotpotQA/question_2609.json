Born in Munich in 1903 as Ruth Landshoff. Her father, Ludwig Landshoff, was a musicologist and conductor[1] and her mother, Philippine Wiesengrund Landshoff, was an soprano opera singer. Her brother, Hermann Landshoff, became a photographer.[2] Their family was Jewish, and their circle of friends in the 1920s included Gerhardt Hauptmann, Thomas Mann, Albert Einstein, and Paul Klee, among other writers, scientists, musicians and artists.[3] At age 19 she moved from Bavaria to Berlin to work as an au pair.[3] Ruth began to learn to draw in 1922.[2] She maintained an interest in the visual arts,[3] and took the advice of her father to draw every day.[citation needed] She also had many connections to the teachers and students at the Bauhaus, such as Erich Mendelssohn, who had designed their Berlin apartment.[3] In 1930 she married the pediatrician Hermann Vollmer, whom she had met in Berlin. Ruth and Hermann moved from Germany (via Liverpool)[2] to New York in 1935.[3].\nThought 2: Ruth Vollmer moved from Germany to New York in 1935.
