Medinilla expands to the Pacific Ocean islands. So both Osteomeles and Medinilla expand to the Pacific Ocean islands.\nAnswer: Both\nAction 1: MeasureUncertainty [Both]\nObservation 1: Answer’s uncertainty is 0.0, which falls within the acceptable threshold of 1.79.\nThought 2: Based on the uncertainty, answer is kept.\nAction 2: Keep Answer.\nAnswer: Both",
