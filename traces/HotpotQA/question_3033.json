The large subunit and small subunit that use two types of RNA are major components that make up ribosome.\nAnswer: ribosome\nAction 1: MeasureUncertainty [ribosome]\nObservation 1: Answer’s uncertainty is 1.1, which falls within the acceptable threshold of 1.79.\nThought 2: Based on the uncertainty, answer is kept.\nAction 2: Keep Answer.\nAnswer: ribosome",
