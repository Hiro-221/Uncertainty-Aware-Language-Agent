I need to search Miami-Dade County next and find the two national parks it is located between.\nAction 2: Search[Miami-Dade County]\nObservation 2: Miami-Dade County (/maɪˈæmi ˈdeɪd/), known simply as Dade County prior to 1997, is a county located in the southeastern part of the U.S. state of Florida. The county had a population of 2,701,767 as of the 2020 census,[4] making it the most populous county in Florida and the seventh-most-populous county in the United States.[8] It is Florida's third largest county by land area with 1,946 square miles (5,040 km2). The county seat is Miami, the core of the nation's sixth-largest and world's 65th-largest metropolitan area with a 2020 population of 6.138 million people, exceeding the population of 31 of the nation's 50 states as of 2022.[9]. As of 2022, Miami-Dade County has a gross domestic product of $184.5 billion, making the county's GDP the largest for any county in the State of Florida and the 14th-largest for the nation's 3,033 counties.[10][11] The county is home to the Port of Miami on Biscayne Bay, the world's largest passenger port with a world record 5.5 million passengers in 2018, and Miami International Airport, the third largest U.S.\nThought 3: Miami-Dade County is located in Florida. I need to search Florida next and find the two national parks it is located between.\nAction 3: Search[Florida]\nObservation 3: Florida (/ˈflɒrɪdə/ ⓘ FLORR-ih-də; Spanish: [floˈɾiða] ⓘ) is a state in the Southeastern region of the United States. It borders the Gulf of Mexico to the west, Alabama to the northwest, Georgia to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the Straits of Florida to the south, and The Bahamas to the southeast. About two-thirds of Florida occupies a peninsula between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. It has the longest coastline in the contiguous United States, spanning approximately 1,350 miles (2,170 km), not including its many barrier islands. It is the only state that borders both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean.\nThought 4: Florida is located in the Southeastern region of the United States. I need to search Southeastern region of the United States next and find the two national parks it is located between.\nAction 4: Search[Southeastern region of the United States]\nObservation 4: Could not find Southeastern region of the United States.

The region includes a core of states that reaches north to Maryland and West Virginia, bordering the Ohio River and Mason–Dixon line, and stretches west to Arkansas and Louisiana.[note 2]. There is no official U.S. government definition for the region, and it is defined variably among agencies and organizations.. The history of the present-day Southeastern United States dates to the dawn of civilization in approximately 11,000 BC or 13,000 BC.\nThought 6: Southeastern United States is located in the eastern portion of the Southern United States and the southern portion of the Eastern United States. I need to search Southern United States next and find the two national parks it is located between.\nAction 6: Search[Southern United States]\nObservation 6: The Southern United States (sometimes Dixie, also referred to as the Southern States, the American South, the Southland, Dixieland, or simply the South) is one of the four census regions defined by the United States Census Bureau. It is between the Atlantic Ocean and the Western United States, with the Midwestern and Northeastern United States to its north and the Gulf of Mexico and Mexico to its south.. Historically, the South was defined as all states south of the 18th-century Mason–Dixon line, the Ohio River, and the 36°30′ parallel.[3] Within the South are different subregions such as the Southeast, South Central, Upper South, and Deep South. Maryland, Delaware, Washington, D.C., and Northern Virginia have become more culturally, economically, and politically aligned in certain aspects with the Northeastern United States and are sometimes identified as part of the Northeast or Mid-Atlantic.[4] The U.S. Census Bureau continues to define all four places as formally being in the South.[5] To account for cultural variations across the region, some scholars have proposed definitions of the South that do not coincide neatly with state boundaries.[6][7] The South does not precisely correspond to the entire geographic south of the United States, but primarily includes the south-central and southeastern states.\nThought 7:",

Historically, the South was defined as all states south of the 18th-century Mason–Dixon line, the Ohio River, and the 36°30′ parallel.[3] Within the South are different subregions such as the Southeast, South Central, Upper South, and Deep South. Maryland, Delaware, Washington, D.C., and Northern Virginia have become more culturally, economically, and politically aligned in certain aspects with the Northeastern United States and are sometimes identified as part of the Northeast or Mid-Atlantic.[4] The U.S. Census Bureau continues to define all four places as formally being in the South.[5] To account for cultural variations across the region, some scholars have proposed definitions of the South that do not coincide neatly with state boundaries.[6][7] The South does not precisely correspond to the entire geographic south of the United States, but primarily includes the south-central and southeastern states.\nThought 9: Southern United States is located in the south-central and southeastern states.
