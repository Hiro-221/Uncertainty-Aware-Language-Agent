The land surrounding the reserve has been extensively altered through agricultural practice and the development of roads. As a remnant in a highly modified landscape, the reserve's vegetation is significant to the region as it includes critically endangered mallee and mallee–broombush in the absence on Spinifex; in total there are only three protected areas within New South Wales containing this now rare vegetative structure.[2][4] The International Union for Conservation of Nature’s category for the reserve is Ia, a protected area that is dedicated to conserving biodiversity and minimising disturbances by limiting human access.[5]. The reserve is relatively flat with a dry, red, loamy clay top soil; three man-made dams are situated along a drainage line that runs the length of the reserve.[2][6].",

So I need to look up eastern sector.\nAction 2: Lookup[eastern sector]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.\nThought 3: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.\nAction 3: Search[High Plains]\nObservation 3: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions:\nThought 4: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).\nAction 4: Search[High Plains (United States)]\nObservation 4: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]\nThought 5: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.\nAction 5: Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who.

So I need to look up eastern sector.\nAction 2: Lookup[eastern sector]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.\nThought 3: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.\nAction 3: Search[High Plains]\nObservation 3: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions:\nThought 4: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).\nAction 4: Search[High Plains (United States)]\nObservation 4: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains.

The 86.4-hectare (213-acre) reserve is situated 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) south of West Wyalong and may be accessed via the Newell Highway and The Charcoal Tank Road.[2] The reserve is an important refuge for native flora and fauna in a highly fragmented landscape, one in which the majority of the original vegetation has been removed.[2][3]. The land surrounding the reserve has been extensively altered through agricultural practice and the development of roads. As a remnant in a highly modified landscape, the reserve's vegetation is significant to the region as it includes critically endangered mallee and mallee–broombush in the absence on Spinifex; in total there are only three protected areas within New South Wales containing this now rare vegetative structure.[2][4] The International Union for Conservation of Nature’s category for the reserve is Ia, a protected area that is dedicated to conserving biodiversity and minimising disturbances by limiting human access.[5]. The reserve is relatively flat with a dry, red, loamy clay top soil; three man-made dams are situated along a drainage line that runs the length of the reserve.[2][6].\nThought 2: The crossroads is Newell Highway and The Charcoal Tank Road.

The 86.4-hectare (213-acre) reserve is situated 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) south of West Wyalong and may be accessed via the Newell Highway and The Charcoal Tank Road.[2] The reserve is an important refuge for native flora and fauna in a highly fragmented landscape, one in which the majority of the original vegetation has been removed.[2][3]. The land surrounding the reserve has been extensively altered through agricultural practice and the development of roads. As a remnant in a highly modified landscape, the reserve's vegetation is significant to the region as it includes critically endangered mallee and mallee–broombush in the absence on Spinifex; in total there are only three protected areas within New South Wales containing this now rare vegetative structure.[2][4] The International Union for Conservation of Nature’s category for the reserve is Ia, a protected area that is dedicated to conserving biodiversity and minimising disturbances by limiting human access.[5]. The reserve is relatively flat with a dry, red, loamy clay top soil; three man-made dams are situated along a drainage line that runs the length of the reserve.[2][6].\nThought 2: The crossroads is Newell Highway and The Charcoal Tank Road. I need to search Newell Highway and The Charcoal Tank Road next.\nAction 2: Search[Newell Highway and The Charcoal Tank Road]\nObservation 2: Could not find Newell Highway and The Charcoal Tank Road.

The land surrounding the reserve has been extensively altered through agricultural practice and the development of roads. As a remnant in a highly modified landscape, the reserve's vegetation is significant to the region as it includes critically endangered mallee and mallee–broombush in the absence on Spinifex; in total there are only three protected areas within New South Wales containing this now rare vegetative structure.[2][4] The International Union for Conservation of Nature’s category for the reserve is Ia, a protected area that is dedicated to conserving biodiversity and minimising disturbances by limiting human access.[5]. The reserve is relatively flat with a dry, red, loamy clay top soil; three man-made dams are situated along a drainage line that runs the length of the reserve.[2][6].\nThought 2: The crossroads is Newell Highway and The Charcoal Tank Road.

The town is located 10 km north of the Charcoal Tank Nature Reserve. The Charcoal Tank Nature Reserve is located at the crossroads of the Stuart Highway and the Lasseter Highway. So the town is located at the crossroads of the Stuart Highway and the Lasseter Highway.\nAnswer: Stuart Highway and Lasseter Highway\nAction 1: MeasureUncertainty [Stuart Highway and Lasseter Highway]\nObservation 1: Answer’s uncertainty is 1.94, which falls outside the acceptable threshold of 1.79.\nThought 2: Based on the uncertainty, I need to use an external tool to solve the question.\nAction 2: Activate Tool.\nThought 3: I need to search Charcoal Tank Nature Reserve, find the crossroads it is located, then find the town located 10 km north of the crossroads.\nAction 3: Search[Charcoal Tank Nature Reserve]\nObservation 3: The Charcoal Tank Nature Reserve is a protected nature reserve in the central western region of New South Wales, Australia. The 86.4-hectare (213-acre) reserve is situated 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) south of West Wyalong and may be accessed via the Newell Highway and The Charcoal Tank Road.[2] The reserve is an important refuge for native flora and fauna in a highly fragmented landscape, one in which the majority of the original vegetation has been removed.[2][3]. The land surrounding the reserve has been extensively altered through agricultural practice and the development of roads. As a remnant in a highly modified landscape, the reserve's vegetation is significant to the region as it includes critically endangered mallee and mallee–broombush in the absence on Spinifex; in total there are only three protected areas within New South Wales containing this now rare vegetative structure.[2][4] The International Union for Conservation of Nature’s category for the reserve is Ia, a protected area that is dedicated to conserving biodiversity and minimising disturbances by limiting human access.[5]. The reserve is relatively flat with a dry, red, loamy clay top soil; three man-made dams are situated along a drainage line that runs the length of the reserve.[2][6].\nThought 4: The crossroads is Newell Highway and The Charcoal Tank Road. I need to search Newell Highway and The Charcoal Tank Road next.\nAction 4: Search[Newell Highway and The Charcoal Tank Road]\nObservation 4: Could not find Newell Highway and The Charcoal Tank Road.
