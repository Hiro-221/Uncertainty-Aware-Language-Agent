The site was originally the location of a Celtic Brittonic fort known as Din Guarie and may have been the capital of the kingdom of Bernicia from its foundation c. 420 to 547.

It consists of County Durham, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear and part of North Yorkshire. With 2.6 million residents in 2022, it is the least populous region of England.

The North West had a population of 7,417,397 in 2021.[4] It is the third-most-populated region in the United Kingdom, after the South East and Greater London. The largest settlements are Manchester and Liverpool. It is one of the three regions, alongside North East England and Yorkshire and the Humber, that make up Northern England.[5]. The official region consists of the following subdivisions:.\nThought 7: North West England is one of nine official regions of England. I need to search the other seven regions next.\nAction 7: Search[Yorkshire and the Humber]\nObservation 7: Yorkshire and the Humber is one of the nine official regions of England at the first level of ITL for statistical purposes.[a] It is one of the three regions covering Northern England, alongside the North West England and North East England regions, and covers the historic and cultural Yorkshire area.. Yorkshire and the Humber is made up of the counties of East Riding of Yorkshire, North Yorkshire (excluding areas in the Tees Valley which are instead part of North East England), South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, and the districts of North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire that are in the county of Lincolnshire (with the rest of the county being within the East Midlands). The population of Yorkshire and the Humber in 2021 was 5,480,774[3] with its largest settlements being Leeds, Sheffield, Bradford, Hull, and York.. In the Yorkshire and the Humber region, there is a very close relationship between the major topographical areas and the underlying geology.[4] The Pennine chain of hills in the west is of Carboniferous origin. The central vale is Permo-Triassic.\nThought 8: Yorkshire and the Humber is one of nine official regions of England. I need to search the other six regions next.\nAction 8: Search[East Midlands]\nObservation 8: The East Midlands is one of nine official regions of England. It comprises the eastern half of the area traditionally known as the Midlands. It consists of Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire (except for North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire), Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire, and Rutland. The region has a land area of 15,623 km2 (6,032 sq mi), with an estimated population 5,063,164 in 2024.[3] With a sufficiency-level world city ranking, Nottingham is the only settlement in the region to be classified by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.[5]. The main cities in the region are Derby, Leicester, Lincoln and Nottingham.\nThought 9: East Midlands is one of nine official regions of England.
