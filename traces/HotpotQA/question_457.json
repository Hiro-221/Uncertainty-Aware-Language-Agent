In Norse mythology, the source of most surviving information about her, she is associated with marriage, prophecy, clairvoyance and motherhood, and dwells in the wetland halls of Fensalir. In wider Germanic mythology, she is known in Old High German as Frīja, in Langobardic as Frēa, in Old English as Frīg, in Old Frisian as Frīa, and in Old Saxon as Frī, all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym *Frijjō. Nearly all sources portray her as the wife of the god Odin..

Fulla is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in skaldic poetry. Volla (Folla) is attested in the \"Horse Cure\" Merseburg Incantation, recorded anonymously in the 10th century in Old High German, in which she assists in healing the wounded foal of Phol and is referred to as Frigg's sister. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess..\nThought 4: Fulla is associated with Frigg.

In the Prose Edda, Lofn is described as gentle in manner and as an arranger of marriages, even when they have been forbidden. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess.. In chapter 35 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, High provides brief descriptions of 16 ásynjur.\nThought 5: Lofn is associated with Frigg. I need to search Hlín next.\nAction 5: Search[Hlín]\nObservation 5: In Norse mythology, Hlín is a goddess associated with the goddess Frigg.

In Norse mythology, the source of most surviving information about her, she is associated with marriage, prophecy, clairvoyance and motherhood, and dwells in the wetland halls of Fensalir. In wider Germanic mythology, she is known in Old High German as Frīja, in Langobardic as Frēa, in Old English as Frīg, in Old Frisian as Frīa, and in Old Saxon as Frī, all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym *Frijjō. Nearly all sources portray her as the wife of the god Odin.. In Old High German and Old Norse sources, she is specifically connected with Fulla, but she is also associated with the goddesses Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth, otherwise personified as an apparently separate entity Jörð (Old Norse: 'Earth').\nThought 3: Frigg is associated with Fulla, Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth.

In Norse mythology, Fulla is described as wearing a golden band and as tending to the ashen box and the footwear owned by the goddess Frigg, and, in addition, Frigg confides in Fulla her secrets. Fulla is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in skaldic poetry. Volla (Folla) is attested in the \"Horse Cure\" Merseburg Incantation, recorded anonymously in the 10th century in Old High German, in which she assists in healing the wounded foal of Phol and is referred to as Frigg's sister. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess..\nThought 4: Fulla is associated with Frigg. I need to search Lofn next.\nAction 4: Search[Lofn]\nObservation 4: In Norse mythology, Lofn (Old Norse: [ˈlovn], possibly \"comforter,\"[1] \"the comforter, the mild,\"[2] or \"loving\"[3]) is a goddess. Lofn is attested in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson and in kennings found in skaldic poetry. In the Prose Edda, Lofn is described as gentle in manner and as an arranger of marriages, even when they have been forbidden. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess.. In chapter 35 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, High provides brief descriptions of 16 ásynjur.\nThought 5: Lofn is associated with Frigg. I need to search Hlín next.\nAction 5: Search[Hlín]\nObservation 5: In Norse mythology, Hlín is a goddess associated with the goddess Frigg. Hlín appears in a poem in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and in kennings found in skaldic poetry. Scholars have debated whether the stanza referring to her in the Prose Edda refers to Frigg. Hlín serves as a given name in Iceland, and Hlín receives veneration in the modern era in Germanic paganism's modern extension, Heathenry.. Scholars frequently explain the meaning behind the goddess's name as 'protector'.[1] The Prose Edda section Gylfaginning derives the name from a verb found in a proverb in an obscure and otherwise unattested Old Norse proverb: Þiaðan af er þat orðtak at sá er forðask hleinir.\nThought 6:",

In Norse mythology, the source of most surviving information about her, she is associated with marriage, prophecy, clairvoyance and motherhood, and dwells in the wetland halls of Fensalir. In wider Germanic mythology, she is known in Old High German as Frīja, in Langobardic as Frēa, in Old English as Frīg, in Old Frisian as Frīa, and in Old Saxon as Frī, all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym *Frijjō. Nearly all sources portray her as the wife of the god Odin..

Fulla is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in skaldic poetry. Volla (Folla) is attested in the \"Horse Cure\" Merseburg Incantation, recorded anonymously in the 10th century in Old High German, in which she assists in healing the wounded foal of Phol and is referred to as Frigg's sister.

In chapter 35 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, High provides brief descriptions of 16 ásynjur.\nThought 5: Lofn is associated with Frigg. I need to search Hlín next.\nAction 5: Search[Hlín]\nObservation 5: In Norse mythology, Hlín is a goddess associated with the goddess Frigg. Hlín appears in a poem in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and in kennings found in skaldic poetry. Scholars have debated whether the stanza referring to her in the Prose Edda refers to Frigg. Hlín serves as a given name in Iceland, and Hlín receives veneration in the modern era in Germanic paganism's modern extension, Heathenry.. Scholars frequently explain the meaning behind the goddess's name as 'protector'.[1] The Prose Edda section Gylfaginning derives the name from a verb found in a proverb in an obscure and otherwise unattested Old Norse proverb: Þiaðan af er þat orðtak at sá er forðask hleinir.\nThought 6: Hlín is associated with Frigg.

  "traj": "Question: What does the goddess associated with the goddess frigg  consists of what tales?\nThought 1:Let's think step by step. The goddess associated with the goddess frigg is Frigg. Frigg consists of the tales of the goddess Frigg.\nAnswer: The tales of the goddess Frigg\nAction 1: MeasureUncertainty [The tales of the goddess Frigg]\nObservation 1: Answer’s uncertainty is 2.08, which falls outside the acceptable threshold of 1.79.\nThought 2: Based on the uncertainty, I need to use an external tool to solve the question.\nAction 2: Activate Tool.\nThought 3: I need to search goddess frigg, find the goddess associated with the goddess frigg, then find what tales it consists of.\nAction 3: Search[goddess frigg]\nObservation 3: Could not find goddess frigg. Similar: ['Frigg', 'Frigg and Freyja common origin hypothesis', 'Freyja (redirect from Freia (goddess))', 'Baldr', 'Fensalir (category Frigg)'].\nThought 4: To find the goddess associated with the goddess frigg, I can search Frigg.\nAction 4: Search[Frigg]\nObservation 4: Frigg (/frɪɡ/; Old Norse: [ˈfriɡː])[1] is a goddess, one of the Æsir, in Germanic mythology. In Norse mythology, the source of most surviving information about her, she is associated with marriage, prophecy, clairvoyance and motherhood, and dwells in the wetland halls of Fensalir. In wider Germanic mythology, she is known in Old High German as Frīja, in Langobardic as Frēa, in Old English as Frīg, in Old Frisian as Frīa, and in Old Saxon as Frī, all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym *Frijjō. Nearly all sources portray her as the wife of the god Odin.. In Old High German and Old Norse sources, she is specifically connected with Fulla, but she is also associated with the goddesses Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth, otherwise personified as an apparently separate entity Jörð (Old Norse: 'Earth').\nThought 5: Frigg is associated with Fulla, Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth. I need to search Fulla, Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and the Earth next.\nAction 5: Search[Fulla]\nObservation 5: Fulla (Old Norse: [ˈfulːɑ], possibly 'bountiful') or Volla (Old High German, 'plenitude') is a goddess in Germanic mythology. In Norse mythology, Fulla is described as wearing a golden band and as tending to the ashen box and the footwear owned by the goddess Frigg, and, in addition, Frigg confides in Fulla her secrets. Fulla is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in skaldic poetry. Volla (Folla) is attested in the \"Horse Cure\" Merseburg Incantation, recorded anonymously in the 10th century in Old High German, in which she assists in healing the wounded foal of Phol and is referred to as Frigg's sister. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess..\nThought 6: Fulla is associated with Frigg. I need to search Lofn next.\nAction 6: Search[Lofn]\nObservation 6: In Norse mythology, Lofn (Old Norse: [ˈlovn], possibly \"comforter,\"[1] \"the comforter, the mild,\"[2] or \"loving\"[3]) is a goddess. Lofn is attested in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson and in kennings found in skaldic poetry. In the Prose Edda, Lofn is described as gentle in manner and as an arranger of marriages, even when they have been forbidden. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess.. In chapter 35 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, High provides brief descriptions of 16 ásynjur.\nThought 7: Lofn is associated with Frigg. I need to search Hlín next.\nAction 7: Search[Hlín]\nObservation 7: In Norse mythology, Hlín is a goddess associated with the goddess Frigg. Hlín appears in a poem in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and in kennings found in skaldic poetry. Scholars have debated whether the stanza referring to her in the Prose Edda refers to Frigg. Hlín serves as a given name in Iceland, and Hlín receives veneration in the modern era in Germanic paganism's modern extension, Heathenry.. Scholars frequently explain the meaning behind the goddess's name as 'protector'.[1] The Prose Edda section Gylfaginning derives the name from a verb found in a proverb in an obscure and otherwise unattested Old Norse proverb: Þiaðan af er þat orðtak at sá er forðask hleinir.\nThought 8: Hlín is associated with Frigg. I need to search Gná next.\nAction 8: Search[Gná]\nObservation 8: In Norse mythology, Gná (Old Norse) is a goddess who runs errands in other worlds for the goddess Frigg and rides the flying, sea-treading horse Hófvarpnir (Old Norse \"he who throws his hoofs about\",[1] \"hoof-thrower\"[2] or \"hoof kicker\"[3]). Gná and Hófvarpnir are attested in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Scholarly have proposed that Gná is a \"goddess of fullness\" and, in the 1800s, as potentially cognate to Fama from Roman mythology. Hófvarpnir and the eight-legged steed Sleipnir have been cited examples of transcendent horses in Norse mythology.. In chapter 35 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, the enthroned figure of High provides brief descriptions of 16 ásynjur.\nThought 9: Gná is associated with Frigg. I need to search the Earth next.\nAction 9: Search[the Earth]\nObservation 9: Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being an ocean world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is at least somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large ice sheets at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers, and atmospheric water combined.\nThought 10: Returned tool-use answer is invalid, I need to use the backoff answer.\nAction 10: Use Backoff Answer.\nAnswer: The tales of the goddess Frigg",
