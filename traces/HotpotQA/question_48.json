Born in Rionegro and raised in Medellín, Escobar briefly attended the Universidad Autónoma Latinoamericana of Medellín but left without graduating.[1][4] He became involved in petty crime during his youth, including selling contraband cigarettes, forging lottery tickets, and stealing cars.[8][5] By the early 1970s, Escobar was working for established smugglers and occasionally engaged in kidnappings for ransom.[1]. During the mid-1970s he began consolidating trafficking networks that later became known as the Medellín Cartel, alongside the Ochoa brothers, Carlos Lehder, and Gonzalo Rodríguez Gacha.[4] The cartel imported coca paste from Peru and Bolivia, processed it in Colombia, and exported cocaine to the United States through a variety of routes and intermediaries.[3].",

His accolades include the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor for his performance in The Secret Agent (2025), as well as a Golden Globe nomination for portraying Pablo Escobar in Narcos, and an Annie Award nomination for his voice performance as Death in Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022).[1]. Widely renowned in Brazil for his performances in popular films and TV shows, he is also one of the most reputable Brazilian actors internationally. He has starred in multiple feature films in Brazil and Hollywood, including Brazilian box office hits like Elite Squad, which won the Golden Bear at the 58th Berlin Internacional Film Festival.

Dubbed the \"King of Cocaine\", Escobar was among the wealthiest criminals of his era. Contemporary Forbes lists—drawing partly on law-enforcement intelligence—placed his 1987 cash flow at least US$3 billion and his net worth at over US$2 billion, with later mentions declining to about US$1 billion by 1993.[6][7]. Born in Rionegro and raised in Medellín, Escobar briefly attended the Universidad Autónoma Latinoamericana of Medellín but left without graduating.[1][4] He became involved in petty crime during his youth, including selling contraband cigarettes, forging lottery tickets, and stealing cars.[8][5] By the early 1970s, Escobar was working for established smugglers and occasionally engaged in kidnappings for ransom.[1]. During the mid-1970s he began consolidating trafficking networks that later became known as the Medellín Cartel, alongside the Ochoa brothers, Carlos Lehder, and Gonzalo Rodríguez Gacha.[4] The cartel imported coca paste from Peru and Bolivia, processed it in Colombia, and exported cocaine to the United States through a variety of routes and intermediaries.[3].\nThought 5: The King of Cocaine is Pablo Escobar.
