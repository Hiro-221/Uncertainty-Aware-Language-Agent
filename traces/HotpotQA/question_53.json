The airport is home to the 642nd Aviation Support Battalion, part of the 42nd Infantry Division.[4]. A 1910 newspaper article cited \"a site near Scottsville Road\", along with the Baker Farm in Genesee Valley Park, as possible locations for \"airships\" to fly from Rochester to Toronto.[5][title missing] The Baker Farm was located south of the original Genesee Valley Park, and was donated to the Parks Department of the City of Rochester in 1908.[6][title missing] The golf course at Genesee Valley Park was extended to include the Baker Farm in 1914.[7][title missing] During World War I, the Baker Farm area of the park, renamed \"Baker Field\", was used for military purposes. The United States School of Aerial Photography had been created at Kodak Park in Rochester, and Baker Field was the airfield associated with the project.[8][title missing] Military use of the field ceased in 1918.[9][title missing] Baker Field continued to be used as an airfield for a year or two thereafter,[10][11][title missing] but flood conditions made it unsuitable for airfield use in the long run.[12][title missing] Britton Field, located just west of Baker Field, became the primary airport for the Rochester area.. The site of the Greater Rochester International Airport, originally known as Britton Field, was used for aviation purposes as early as 1919.\nThought 2:",

The airport is home to the 642nd Aviation Support Battalion, part of the 42nd Infantry Division.[4].
