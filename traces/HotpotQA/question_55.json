Sacagawea traveled with the expedition thousands of miles from North Dakota to the Pacific Ocean, helping to establish cultural contacts with Native American people and contributing to the expedition's knowledge of natural history in different regions.. The National American Woman Suffrage Association of the early 20th century adopted Sacagawea as a symbol of women's worth and independence, erecting several statues and plaques in her memory, and doing much to recount her accomplishments.[6].

They traditionally lived in the Lemhi River Valley and along the upper Salmon River in Idaho.[1] Bands were very fluid and nomadic, and they often interacted with and intermarried other bands of Shoshone and other tribes, such as the Bannock.[2] Today most of them are enrolled in the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes of the Fort Hall Reservation of Idaho.. The Akaitikka are Numic speakers, speaking the Shoshone language.[3]. Fishing is an important source of food, and salmon, and trout were staples. Gooseberries and camas root, Camassia quamash are traditional vegetable foods for the Lemhi Shoshone.[4] In the 19th century, buffalo hunting provided meat, furs, hides, and other materials.[5].\nThought 3: Lemhi Shoshone speaks Shoshone language.

Sacagawea traveled with the expedition thousands of miles from North Dakota to the Pacific Ocean, helping to establish cultural contacts with Native American people and contributing to the expedition's knowledge of natural history in different regions.. The National American Woman Suffrage Association of the early 20th century adopted Sacagawea as a symbol of women's worth and independence, erecting several statues and plaques in her memory, and doing much to recount her accomplishments.[6]. Reliable historical information about Sacagawea is very limited.. According to Toussaint Charbonneau, her husband, she was born c. 1788 into the Agaidika ('Salmon Eater', aka Lemhi Shoshone) tribe near present-day Salmon, Idaho.\nThought 2: Sacagawea was born into the Agaidika tribe. I need to search Agaidika next.\nAction 2: Search[Agaidika]\nObservation 2: The Lemhi Shoshone are a tribe of Northern Shoshone, also called the Akaitikka, Agaidika, or \"Eaters of Salmon\".[1] The name \"Lemhi\" comes from Fort Lemhi, a Mormon mission to this group. They traditionally lived in the Lemhi River Valley and along the upper Salmon River in Idaho.[1] Bands were very fluid and nomadic, and they often interacted with and intermarried other bands of Shoshone and other tribes, such as the Bannock.[2] Today most of them are enrolled in the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes of the Fort Hall Reservation of Idaho.. The Akaitikka are Numic speakers, speaking the Shoshone language.[3]. Fishing is an important source of food, and salmon, and trout were staples. Gooseberries and camas root, Camassia quamash are traditional vegetable foods for the Lemhi Shoshone.[4] In the 19th century, buffalo hunting provided meat, furs, hides, and other materials.[5].\nThought 3: Lemhi Shoshone speaks Shoshone language. I need to search Shoshone language next.\nAction 3: Search[Shoshone language]\nObservation 3: Shoshoni, also written as Shoshoni-Gosiute and Shoshone (/ʃoʊˈʃoʊni/ shoh-SHOH-nee;[2] Shoshoni: soni' ta̲i̲kwappe, newe ta̲i̲kwappe or neme ta̲i̲kwappeh), is a Numic language of the Uto-Aztecan family, spoken in the Western United States by the Shoshone people. Shoshoni is primarily spoken in the Great Basin, in areas of Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, and Idaho.[3]: 1. The consonant inventory of Shoshoni is rather small, but a much wider range of surface forms of these phonemes appear in the spoken language. The language has six vowels, distinguished by length.[3]: 3  Shoshoni is a strongly suffixing language, and it inflects for nominal number and case and for verbal aspect and tense using suffixes. Word order is relatively free but shows a preference toward subject-object-verb (SOV) order.[4].\nThought 4:",

Jean Baptiste Charbonneau spoke Shoshone, Hidatsa, French, and English.\nAnswer: Shoshone, Hidatsa, French, English\nAction 1: MeasureUncertainty [Shoshone, Hidatsa, French, English]\nObservation 1: Answer’s uncertainty is 2.48, which falls outside the acceptable threshold of 1.79.\nThought 2: Based on the uncertainty, I need to use an external tool to solve the question.\nAction 2: Activate Tool.\nThought 3: I need to search Sacagawea, find her son, then find what languages he speaks.\nAction 3: Search[Sacagawea]\nObservation 3: Sacagawea (/ˌsækədʒəˈwiːə/ SAK-ə-jə-WEE-ə or /səˌkɒɡəˈweɪə/ sə-KOG-ə-WAY-ə;[1] also spelled Sakakawea or Sacajawea; May c. 1788 – December 20, 1812)[2][3][4] was a Lemhi Shoshone or Hidatsa[5] woman who, in her teens, helped the Lewis and Clark Expedition in achieving their chartered mission objectives by exploring the Louisiana Territory. Sacagawea traveled with the expedition thousands of miles from North Dakota to the Pacific Ocean, helping to establish cultural contacts with Native American people and contributing to the expedition's knowledge of natural history in different regions.. The National American Woman Suffrage Association of the early 20th century adopted Sacagawea as a symbol of women's worth and independence, erecting several statues and plaques in her memory, and doing much to recount her accomplishments.[6]. Reliable historical information about Sacagawea is very limited.. According to Toussaint Charbonneau, her husband, she was born c. 1788 into the Agaidika ('Salmon Eater', aka Lemhi Shoshone) tribe near present-day Salmon, Idaho.\nThought 4: Sacagawea was born into the Agaidika tribe. I need to search Agaidika next.\nAction 4: Search[Agaidika]\nObservation 4: The Lemhi Shoshone are a tribe of Northern Shoshone, also called the Akaitikka, Agaidika, or \"Eaters of Salmon\".[1] The name \"Lemhi\" comes from Fort Lemhi, a Mormon mission to this group. They traditionally lived in the Lemhi River Valley and along the upper Salmon River in Idaho.[1] Bands were very fluid and nomadic, and they often interacted with and intermarried other bands of Shoshone and other tribes, such as the Bannock.[2] Today most of them are enrolled in the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes of the Fort Hall Reservation of Idaho.. The Akaitikka are Numic speakers, speaking the Shoshone language.[3]. Fishing is an important source of food, and salmon, and trout were staples. Gooseberries and camas root, Camassia quamash are traditional vegetable foods for the Lemhi Shoshone.[4] In the 19th century, buffalo hunting provided meat, furs, hides, and other materials.[5].\nThought 5: Lemhi Shoshone speaks Shoshone language. I need to search Shoshone language next.\nAction 5: Search[Shoshone language]\nObservation 5: Shoshoni, also written as Shoshoni-Gosiute and Shoshone (/ʃoʊˈʃoʊni/ shoh-SHOH-nee;[2] Shoshoni: soni' ta̲i̲kwappe, newe ta̲i̲kwappe or neme ta̲i̲kwappeh), is a Numic language of the Uto-Aztecan family, spoken in the Western United States by the Shoshone people. Shoshoni is primarily spoken in the Great Basin, in areas of Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, and Idaho.[3]: 1. The consonant inventory of Shoshoni is rather small, but a much wider range of surface forms of these phonemes appear in the spoken language. The language has six vowels, distinguished by length.[3]: 3  Shoshoni is a strongly suffixing language, and it inflects for nominal number and case and for verbal aspect and tense using suffixes. Word order is relatively free but shows a preference toward subject-object-verb (SOV) order.[4].\nThought 6: Shoshone language is spoken in the Great Basin, in areas of Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, and Idaho.
