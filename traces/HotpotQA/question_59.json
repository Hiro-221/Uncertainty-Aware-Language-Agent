So Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin have the same type of work. \nAction 3: Finish[yes]\nQuestion: Both Bo Diddley and The Yardbirds played which common genre of music during their careers?\nThought 1: I need to search Bo Diddley and The Yardbirds, find their genres of music, then find the common genre of music.\nAction 1: Search[Bo Diddley]\nObservation 1: Ellas Bates McDaniel (December 30, 1928 – June 2, 2008), known professionally as Bo Diddley, was an American guitarist and singer who played a key role in the transition from the blues to rock and roll. He influenced many artists, including Buddy Holly,[3] the Beatles, the Rolling Stones,[4] the Animals, George Thorogood, Syd Barrett,[5] and the Clash.[6]. His use of African rhythms and a signature beat, a simple five-accent hambone rhythm, is a cornerstone of hip hop, rock, and pop music.[4][7][8] In recognition of his achievements, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, the Blues Hall of Fame in 2003, and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2017.[9][7][10] He received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.[11] Diddley is also recognized for his technical innovations, including his use of tremolo and reverb effects to enhance the sound of his distinctive rectangular guitars.[12][13]. Bo Diddley was born in McComb, Mississippi,[nb 1] as Ellas Otha Bates (also stated as Otha Ellas Bates or Elias Otha Bates).[15] He was the only child of Ethel Wilson, a  sharecropper's teenaged daughter, and Eugene Bates,[16] whom he never knew. Wilson was only sixteen, and being unable to support a family, she gave her cousin, Gussie McDaniel,[17] permission to raise her son.[14] McDaniel eventually adopted him, and he assumed her surname.[18] Diddley vehemently denied ever having the name \"Otha\" in a 2001 interview, saying \"My name is not 'Otha'...\nThought 2:",
      "output": "Bo Diddley's genre of music is blues, rock and roll, rhythm and blues, and pop music. I need to search The Yardbirds next and find its genre of music.\nAction 2: Search[The Yardbirds]\nObservation 2: The Yardbirds are an English rock band, formed in London in 1963. The band's core lineup featured vocalist and harmonica player Keith Relf, drummer Jim McCarty, rhythm guitarist/bassist Chris Dreja and bassist/producer Paul",

The band started the careers of three of rock's most famous guitarists: Eric Clapton (1963–1965), Jeff Beck (1965–1966) and Jimmy Page (1966–1968), all of whom ranked in the top five of Rolling Stone magazine's 2011 list of 100 greatest guitarists.[5] The band's other members during 1963–1968 were vocalist/harmonica player Keith Relf, drummer Jim McCarty, rhythm guitarist Chris Dreja, and bassist Paul Samwell-Smith, with Dreja switching to bass when Samwell-Smith departed in 1966. The band had a string of hits throughout the mid-1960s, including \"For Your Love\", \"Heart Full of Soul\", \"Shapes of Things\", and \"Over Under Sideways Down\".. Originally a blues-based band noted for their signature \"rave-up\" instrumental breaks,[6] the Yardbirds broadened their range into pop, pioneered psychedelic rock and early hard rock, and contributed to many electric guitar innovations of the mid-1960s. Some rock critics and historians also cite their influence on the later punk rock, progressive rock, and heavy metal trends.[7][6] Following the band's split in 1968, Relf and McCarty formed Renaissance, and Page formed Led Zeppelin.",

So the common genre of music during their careers is blues and rhythm and blues.\nAnswer: blues, rhythm and blues\nAction 1: MeasureUncertainty [blues, rhythm and blues]\nObservation 1: Answer’s uncertainty is 2.08, which falls outside the acceptable threshold of 1.79.\nThought 2: Based on the uncertainty, I need to use an external tool to solve the question.\nAction 2: Activate Tool.\nThought 3: I need to search Bo Diddley and The Yardbirds, find their genres of music, then find the common genre of music.\nAction 3: Search[Bo Diddley]\nObservation 3: Ellas Bates McDaniel (December 30, 1928 – June 2, 2008), known professionally as Bo Diddley, was an American guitarist and singer who played a key role in the transition from the blues to rock and roll. He influenced many artists, including Buddy Holly,[3] the Beatles, the Rolling Stones,[4] the Animals, George Thorogood, Syd Barrett,[5] and the Clash.[6]. His use of African rhythms and a signature beat, a simple five-accent hambone rhythm, is a cornerstone of hip hop, rock, and pop music.[4][7][8] In recognition of his achievements, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, the Blues Hall of Fame in 2003, and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2017.[9][7][10] He received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.[11] Diddley is also recognized for his technical innovations, including his use of tremolo and reverb effects to enhance the sound of his distinctive rectangular guitars.[12][13]. Bo Diddley was born in McComb, Mississippi,[nb 1] as Ellas Otha Bates (also stated as Otha Ellas Bates or Elias Otha Bates).[15] He was the only child of Ethel Wilson, a  sharecropper's teenaged daughter, and Eugene Bates,[16] whom he never knew. Wilson was only sixteen, and being unable to support a family, she gave her cousin, Gussie McDaniel,[17] permission to raise her son.[14] McDaniel eventually adopted him, and he assumed her surname.[18] Diddley vehemently denied ever having the name \"Otha\" in a 2001 interview, saying \"My name is not 'Otha'...\nThought 4: Bo Diddley's genre of music is blues, rock and roll, rhythm and blues, and pop music. I need to search The Yardbirds next and find its genre of music.\nAction 4: Search[The Yardbirds]\nObservation 4: The Yardbirds are an English rock band formed in London in 1963. The band started the careers of three of rock's most famous guitarists: Eric Clapton (1963–1965), Jeff Beck (1965–1966) and Jimmy Page (1966–1968), all of whom ranked in the top five of Rolling Stone magazine's 2011 list of 100 greatest guitarists.[5] The band's other members during 1963–1968 were vocalist/harmonica player Keith Relf, drummer Jim McCarty, rhythm guitarist Chris Dreja, and bassist Paul Samwell-Smith, with Dreja switching to bass when Samwell-Smith departed in 1966. The band had a string of hits throughout the mid-1960s, including \"For Your Love\", \"Heart Full of Soul\", \"Shapes of Things\", and \"Over Under Sideways Down\".. Originally a blues-based band noted for their signature \"rave-up\" instrumental breaks,[6] the Yardbirds broadened their range into pop, pioneered psychedelic rock and early hard rock, and contributed to many electric guitar innovations of the mid-1960s. Some rock critics and historians also cite their influence on the later punk rock, progressive rock, and heavy metal trends.[7][6] Following the band's split in 1968, Relf and McCarty formed Renaissance, and Page formed Led Zeppelin.\nThought 5: The Yardbirds' genre of music is blues, pop, psychedelic rock, hard rock, and heavy metal.
