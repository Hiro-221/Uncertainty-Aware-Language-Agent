Rodriguez is the chairman and chief executive officer of A-Rod Corp as well as the chairman of Presidente beer.[1] He owns a controlling interest in the National Basketball Association's Minnesota Timberwolves with Marc Lore.[2] Rodriguez began his professional baseball career as one of the sport's most highly touted prospects, and is considered one of the greatest baseball players of all time.[3][4][5]. With a career .295 batting average, Rodriguez amassed over 600 home runs (696), over 2,000 runs batted in (RBI), over 2,000 runs scored, over 3,000 hits, and over 300 stolen bases, the only player in MLB history to achieve all of those feats.

Since 1931, the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) has bestowed a most valuable player award to a player in the National League and a player in the American League. Before 1931, two similar awards were issued: the League Award was issued during 1922–1928 in the American League and during 1924–1929 in the National League.[1] During 1911–1914, the Chalmers Award was issued to a player in each league.[2] Criteria and a list of winners for these two earlier awards are detailed in below sections..

These voters consider several offensive statistics, including batting average, slugging percentage, and on-base percentage, as well as their \"general impressions of a player's overall offensive value\".[1] They are not permitted to vote for players on their team.[1]. The award is a bat-shaped trophy, three feet (91 cm) tall, engraved with the names of each of the winners from the league[1] and plated with sterling silver.[2] It is given by Hillerich & Bradsby, the manufacturer of Louisville Slugger bats.[3].
