Tricyrtis has 25 species. 1 (Leitneria) < 25 (Tricyrtis), so Tricyrtis has more species.\nAnswer: Tricyrtis\nAction 1: MeasureUncertainty [Tricyrtis]\nObservation 1: Answer’s uncertainty is 1.39, which falls within the acceptable threshold of 1.79.\nThought 2: Based on the uncertainty, answer is kept.\nAction 2: Keep Answer.\nAnswer: Tricyrtis",
