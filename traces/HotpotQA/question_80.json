In the seventh season, Hayley's boyfriend (turned husband) Jeff Fischer joined the main cast, followed by Rogu, Roger's neoplastic son who joined in season fifteen.

Early in the series, Francine is often seen as the voice of reason in her dysfunctional family, adopting the stereotypical role of the long-suffering wife or doting mother. However, as the show progresses, her backstory develops with allusions to unconventional and surreal activities, including working for strip clubs, underground fighting rings, cult memberships, multiple murders, and substance abuse..
