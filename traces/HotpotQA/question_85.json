So the answer is 1848 to 1851.\nAnswer: 1848 to 1851\nAction 1: MeasureUncertainty [1848 to 1851]\nObservation 1: Answer’s uncertainty is 2.4, which falls outside the acceptable threshold of 1.79.\nThought 2: Based on the uncertainty, I need to use an external tool to solve the question.\nAction 2: Activate Tool.\nThought 3: I need to search Samuel Thurston, find the region that existed as an organized incorporated territory of the United States, then find when it existed.\nAction 3: Search[Samuel Thurston]\nObservation 3: Samuel Royal Thurston (April 15, 1816 – April 9, 1851) was an American pioneer, lawyer and politician. He was the first delegate from the Oregon Territory to the United States Congress and was instrumental in the passage of the Donation Land Claim Act.. Thurston was born in Monmouth, Maine, and grew up in Peru, Maine; his father died when he was young.[1] After attending Dartmouth College, he graduated in 1843 from Bowdoin College in Maine, graduating with honors.[1] He then studied law under Robert Dunlap.[1] Thurston met Elizabeth McLench in college and married her after graduating.[2] The couple moved to Burlington, Iowa in 1845.[3]. Thurston came to the Oregon Country in 1847 as an emigrant over the Oregon Trail. In Oregon he settled in Hillsboro, where he practiced law.[1] Then in 1848 he was elected to the Provisional Legislature from Tuality District where he served with fellow Hillsboro resident David Hill.[4] In 1849, Thurston was selected to represent the Oregon Territory in the U.S.\nThought 4: Samuel Thurston was the first delegate from the Oregon Territory to the United States Congress.

Originally claimed by several countries (see Oregon Country), Spanish \"El Orejón\"[citation needed] was part of the Territorio de Nutca (1789–1795), later in the 19th century, the region was divided between the British Empire and the US in 1846.

Originally inhabited by Native Americans, the region that became the Oregon Territory was explored by Europeans first by sea.\nThought 5: Oregon Territory existed from August 14, 1848, until February 14, 1859.
