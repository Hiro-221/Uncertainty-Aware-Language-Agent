So I need to look up eastern sector.\nAction 2: Lookup[eastern sector]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.\nThought 3: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.\nAction 3: Search[High Plains]\nObservation 3: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions:\nThought 4: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).\nAction 4: Search[High Plains (United States)]\nObservation 4: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains.

He was the first delegate from the Oregon Territory to the United States Congress and was instrumental in the passage of the Donation Land Claim Act.. Thurston was born in Monmouth, Maine, and grew up in Peru, Maine; his father died when he was young.[1] After attending Dartmouth College, he graduated in 1843 from Bowdoin College in Maine, graduating with honors.[1] He then studied law under Robert Dunlap.[1] Thurston met Elizabeth McLench in college and married her after graduating.[2] The couple moved to Burlington, Iowa in 1845.[3]. Thurston came to the Oregon Country in 1847 as an emigrant over the Oregon Trail. In Oregon he settled in Hillsboro, where he practiced law.[1] Then in 1848 he was elected to the Provisional Legislature from Tuality District where he served with fellow Hillsboro resident David Hill.[4] In 1849, Thurston was selected to represent the Oregon Territory in the U.S.\nThought 4: Samuel Thurston was the first delegate from the Oregon Territory to the United States Congress.

Originally claimed by several countries (see Oregon Country), Spanish \"El Orejón\"[citation needed] was part of the Territorio de Nutca (1789–1795), later in the 19th century, the region was divided between the British Empire and the US in 1846. When established, the territory encompassed an area that included the current states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho, as well as parts of Wyoming and Montana.

Originally inhabited by Native Americans, the region that became the Oregon Territory was explored by Europeans first by sea.\nThought 5: Oregon Territory existed from August 14, 1848, until February 14, 1859.
